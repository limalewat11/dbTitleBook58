<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>From Mindfulness to Heartfulness: Transforming Self and Society with Compassion</h2><p><b>Open Mind, Open Heart</b><br> Millions have found mindfulness to be a powerful practice for reducing stress, enhancing attention, and instilling tranquility. But it can offer so much more&#x2014;it can transform you, make you more fully awake, alive, and aware of your connection to all beings. In Japanese, the character that best expresses mindfulness, &#x5ff5;, consists of two parts&#x2014;the top part, &#x4eca;, meaning &#x201c;now,&#x201d; and the bottom part, &#x5fc3;, meaning &#x201c;heart.&#x201d; Using stories from his own life as the son of an Irish father and a Japanese mother, a professor in Japan and America, a psychotherapist, a father, and a husband, Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu describes eight &#x201c;heartfulness&#x201d; principles that help us realize that the deepest expression of an enlightened mind is found in our relation to others.</p><p>Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu is a Stanford University psychologist with a doctorate from Harvard University and training in yoga, meditation, and Chinese medicine. His previous books include Multicultural Encounters and When Half Is Whole, as well as the Japanese bestseller The Stanford University Mindfulness Classroom.&#x201c;<i>From Mindfulness to Heartfulness </i>is a rare gem&#x2014;beautifully written, deeply engaging, and filled with valuable and authentic teachings about practical and spiritual paths toward balance and understanding. As Murphy-Shigematsu embraces his vulnerability, he opens up to and reflects upon his life stories, and that can inspire us to do the same&#x2014;encouraging us toward knowledge and understanding. Just what is needed to bring the increasingly popular mindfulness approach back to its reality core&#x2014;the blending of heartfulness with mindfulness.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Richard Katz, PhD, Professor Emeritus, First Nations University of Canada, and author of Indigenous Healing Psychology</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Through tender teaching stories and an insightful narrative, Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu shows us the ways we can weave together mindfulness and compassion into what he terms <i>heartfulness.</i> As master educator, he leads us through the stages of heartfulness from vulnerability and connectedness to acceptance and gratitude. This is an important book. I heartfully recommend it to all who want to join their own personal journey of self-discovery to selfless service and the care for others.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Arthur&nbsp;Zajonc, Professor of Physics Emeritus, Amherst College, and former President, Mind and Life Institute</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;This book has the potential for radical change in the way we live together, and I loved reading it!&nbsp;Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu&nbsp;takes us beyond mindfulness as it is often currently taught&#x2014;as an instrument for cognitive changes like focus, attention, or stress relief&#x2014;to the truths of the gentle, appreciative, nurturing heart. He shows us through stories and practices how to expand our contemplative lives from being self-focused to being inclusive, connected, compassionate, and responsible. Immense heartfulness shines through every story he tells, drawing on experiences from teaching children and college students to being with his dying grandmother to his own biracial childhood. Each story is a jewel, opening the heart. He connects heartfulness to social justice, leadership, and education and offers simple, direct instructions for seven heartful practices.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Mirabai Bush, Senior Fellow, The Center for Contemplative Mind in Society, and author of Compassion in Action&nbsp;(with Ram Dass) and&nbsp;Contemplative Practices in Higher Education&nbsp;(with Daniel Barbezat)</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This powerful book is full of love and intimate wisdom. Full of rich stories and deep guidance, it is also a map of the human heart and the best in all of us.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Roshi Joan Halifax, PhD, Abbot, Upaya Institute and Zen Center</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Resonant with Stephen&#x2019;s kindness, heartfulness, and wisdom and filled with excellent exercises and practical guides, this lovely volume will be a friend and guide to all those intent on creating and sustaining thriving lives, workplaces, relationships, and communities.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Dan Barbezat, Professor of Economics, Amherst College</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;A profound and wise book written by a respected colleague and friend . . . this book humbly reminds us that mindfulness without the heart&nbsp;is lacking and shows the way to live our lives with awareness, compassion, and responsibility.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Frederic Luskin PhD, cofounder of LifeWorks, Stanford University, and author of Forgive for Good</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t put this book down! Dr. Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu&#x2019;s <i>From Mindfulness to Heartfulness</i> is a profound exploration in heartful connection with ourselves and others. Through moving storytelling, Murphy-Shigematsu offers several integral components to cultivating a heartful way of being. Drawing on examples from his college teaching, his many talks to corporations and public audiences, and vulnerable moments from his own life, Murphy-Shigematsu illustrates what this heartful journey might look like&#x2014;<i>he is in it with us.</i>&nbsp;He models the vulnerability heartfulness calls for, exploring the fraught experience of living a biracial identity in the racial contexts of both the United States and Japan. The insights that result offer a model of compassionate transformation that are applicable in a variety of contexts, including social justice, education, health care, corporations, and community work.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This book is accessible, mesmerizing, and practical, offering both deep insights to ponder for days and practical tips to enact right now. It promises to become a classic mindfulness resource.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Beth Berila, PhD, RYT 500, Director, Women&#x2019;s Studies Program, St. Cloud State University</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Master listener Dr. Murphy-Shigematsu demonstrates his attunement to the needs of a multicultural and stress-filled world by distilling wisdom stories from a range of perspectives to illuminate the holistic dynamics of heartfulness. His intimate stories exemplify how to live with heartfulness. They inspire and empower us to heal through a mindful awareness that plumbs the personally and socially transformative power of heartfulness.&#x201d; <br> <b><i>&#x2014;Paula Arai, PhD, Associate Professor, Harvard University, and author of Women Living Zen and Bringing Zen Home</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The focus is not on how you can reduce stress through mindfulness but on teachings that sensitively and carefully show us a valuable way that humans can live good lives.&#x201d; <br> <b><i>&#x2014;Roshi Nanrei Yokota, Enkaku-ji Zen Temple Master </i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A moving testament and sharing of the lessons learned from the author&#x2019;s grandmother, the daughter of a samurai, who taught him the art of living with heartfulness. The book is the distillation of many years of searching for authenticity, making peace with his vulnerabilities, exploring his connectedness with others, and finding his unique purpose in life. I am deeply moved by his stories of integrating the American and Japanese values and his insights on achieving mindfulness. The exercises in the book are a helpful guide for us to find our own meaning in our lives.&#x201d; <br> <b><i>&#x2014;Reiko Homma-True, Professor Emerita, Alliant International University</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Murphy-Shigematsu, through vivid and insightful storytelling, shows how our connections to our ethnic and cultural heritage can guide and enrich our search for both enlightenment and social justice.&nbsp;The beautiful stories here bring vivid color to the practice of mindfulness that may seem like a world of whiteness in which race and culture are dismissed as worldly distractions on the spiritual journey.&#x201d; <br> <b><i>&#x2014;Satsuki Ina, PhD, filmmaker, psychotherapist, and community activist </i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dr. Murphy-Shigematsu&#x2019;s book offers an insightful new perspective on practicing mindfulness to cultivate heartful interconnections instead of just using it for stress reduction. This book is a timely and a much-needed intervention/response to corporate mindfulness. Using cultural and personal stories, Dr. Murphy-Shigematsu offers a moving narrative account of cultivating compassionate wisdom by opening our heart to listen to stories in and around our lives. The book is moving, wonderful, and heartfelt and an excellent guide to fully engaging in life with our heart.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>&#x2014;Ramaswami Mahalingam, Professor of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor </i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wisdom of the heart. Murphy-Shigematsu&#x2019;s gentle storytelling deftly illustrates a compassionate centering to the mindfulness movement sweeping across the country. In sharing the wisdom of his grandmother, he reminds us that outward-focused love and compassion are the complements to inward-focused peace and clarity. Significantly, this recentering is developed through stories that are cross-cultural and intercultural, illustrating how heartfulness provides compassionate pathways for navigating increasingly diverse societies. A valuable book.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2014;Anthony Lising Antonio, Associate Professor of Education, Stanford University<br><br></i>&#x201c;In a society where supposed &#x2018;intelligence&#x2019; is measured by a person&#x2019;s ability to analyze and compute, Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu reminds us that the depth of our humanity is more than a number, an algorithm, or a test score. In a powerful story only he can tell, Stephen shows us a workable path that crosses cultures, boundaries, and identities that stitches a broken world back together.&#x201d;<i><br> <b><i>&#x2014;Jeremy Hunter, PhD, Founding Director, Executive Mind Leadership Institute, Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> </i>&#x201c;Mindfulness has become a contemporary clich�, all too often taken far from its roots to be practiced in ways that exemplify the very problems of solipsism and disregard it was meant to transform. Encouraging us instead toward heartfulness, Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu returns us to the importance of presence, empathy, and compassion. With humor, humility, and vulnerability, he guides us back toward thinking of how we might live, work, and act together in diverse and inclusive communities.&#x201d;<i><br> <b><i>&#x2014;Jeff Chang, author of We Gon&#x2019; Be Alright</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> </i>&#x201c;Murphy-Shigematsu is a master of storytelling. By artfully weaving together personal threads of his bicultural upbringing with accessible spiritual practices informed by Buddhism and modern psychotherapy, he becomes our friend and Sherpa, guiding us to reaching our highest human potential. Heartfulness is a life-changing philosophy of life, intended to heal not only individuals but communities at large. Reading this book will make you a better person.&#x201d;<i><br> <b><i>&#x2014;Isabel Stenzel Byrnes, hospice worker and coauthor (with Anabel Stenzel) of The Power of Two</i></b><br></i></p><h2>Philosophy of Expressive Arts Therapy</h2><p><p>Laying the philosophical foundations of expressive arts therapy, this book highlights the role and importance of <i>poiesis</i>, the art of 'making' as a response to the world, in the expressive arts therapies as well as our own lives. </p><p> The concept of <i>poiesis</i> was originally developed and brought into the field by Stephen K. Levine. It is a perspective that restores the primacy of the arts for the arts therapies instead of reducing art-making and art-objects to psychological data. Bringing together different schools of thought in unexpected ways, this book shows how the principles underlying expressive arts therapy have relevance to ethics, politics and social change. It includes chapters on Taoism, improvisation in the arts, and the importance of creativity for understanding human existence.</p><p> With personal narratives and poetry to help create natural points for the reader to stop and reflect, <i>Philosophy of Expressive Arts Therapy </i>is the perfect guide for those wanting to understand the role of the arts and art-making in life and in therapeutic change.</p></p><p>The first book to focus on the philosophical foundations of expressive arts therapy<b>Stephen K. Levine</b> is Professor Emeritus at York University in Toronto and Founding Dean of the Doctoral Program in Expressive Arts at the European Graduate School, Switzerland.

Titillating text messages. It's-not-you-it's-me relationship-enders. In <i>Other People&#x2019;s Love Letters</i>, Bill Shapiro has searched America&#x2019;s attics, closets, and cigar boxes and found actual letters&#x2013;unflinchingly honest missives full of lust, provocation, guilt, and vulnerability&#x2013;written only for a lover&#x2019;s eyes. Modern love, of course, is not all bliss, and in these pages you&#x2019;ll find the full range of a relationship, with its whispered promises as well as its heartache. But what at first appears to be a deliciously voyeuristic peek into other people&#x2019;s most passionate moments, will ultimately reawaken your own desires and tenderness...because when you read these letters, you&#x2019;ll find the heart you&#x2019;re looking into is actually your own.<br><br>� "i think UR great. wanna have wine &amp; Tequila again sometime?"<br><br>� "I can't believe you're real, and I think about you constantly in some way or the other all day. I haven't given the finger to anyone driving since I met you."<br><br>� "With you I learned how to fight cleaner, how to talk things out better, and how to make a strong loving family out of nothing. These are priceless gifts that I will carry with me the rest of my life. One more thing you did for me: you left, and I had to get through it."<br><br>� "P.S. I look forward to your letters too much to call. Also, where do you stand on chains?"</p><p>Bill Shapiro is the former editor of LIFE magazine. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.&#x201c;If I have learned only one thing from a) personal experience and b) Vivian Cash's fascinating memoir, <i>I Walked the Line</i>, it is this: No human can compose a love letter without seeming slightly insane. Love letters are like suicide notes -- if someone is in the emotional position to consider writing one, they're generally in the worst psychological position to make any cogent sense. That disconnect is what makes <i>Other People's Love Letters: 150 Letters You Were Never Meant to See</i> &nbsp;a painfully entertaining twelve-minute read. Edited by former <i>Life</i> magazine editor Bill Shapiro (and presented like Davy Rothbart's Found series), the book delivers exactly what it purports: random personal letters from people who are either wildly ecstatic or profoundly depressed over the condition of their romantic existence. (One of my favorite entries is from a person who just printed the word liar 183 consecutive times.) Judging from the contents of these notes, we appear to live in a society that is sex crazed and optimistic yet consumed with deep regret. This is probably true. Making matters all the more interesting is Shapiro's epilogue -- he contacts several of the contributors and finds out how the relationship worked out, postletter.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Esquire, Chuck Klosterman<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Bill Shapiro (Time Inc.'s development editor) collects extremely private correspondence, which he has amassed in <i>Other People's Love Letters</i>. The notes, e-mails, telegrams, and letters appear as copies of the originals, in all their faded, tearstained glory. The earliest examples come off as gorgeous and romantic, whether they're pages of elegant script or a few words scrawled on a cocktail napkin. E-mail seems to have had a decidedly negative effect on the art, if ''Am having terribly naughty thoughts again today, and I was wondering if you might want to hear about them'' is any indication. After compulsively flipping through to the last page, I have just one question: How did Shapiro get people to part with these?&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Entertainment Weekly<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;From the moment Bill Shapiro stumbled upon an old love letter that wasn&#x2019;t his (it was an ode to his then girlfriend from some earlier man), he was hooked. His new book, <i>Other People&#x2019;s Love Letters</i>, reprints 150 of the many hundreds he&#x2019;s collected over the years. Strictly speaking, they&#x2019;re not all declarations of love. Some are Dear Johns; others are postmortems of failed relationships. And not all of them are letters, in the stationary-and-envelope sense. They&#x2019;re scrawled across postcards, crammed onto Post-its, scribbled on cocktail napkins and matchbooks. Some are old (Peter J. Dougherty, chief of police, to &#x2018;dearest Lizzie,&#x2019; dated December 22, 1911); some are new (e-mails, text messages, more e-mails). Should going through them strike you as voyeuristic, beware. They&#x2019;re addictive.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;O Magazine</p><h2>A Lullaby to Awaken the Heart: The Aspiration Prayer of Samantabhadra and Its Tibetan Commentaries</h2><p><b>A key Dzogchen text&#x2014;available together with its Tibetan commentaries, including from the fifteenth Karmapa&#x2014;from a preeminent translator.</b><br><br><i>The Aspiration Prayer of Samantabhadra</i>, one of the most famous and often-recited Dzogchen texts, is at once an entreaty by the primordial buddha, Samantabhadra, that all sentient beings recognize the nature of their minds and thus become buddhas, and also a wake-up call by our own buddha nature itself.

It was his inborn gift that all the paths of the past were visible to him. Humans and animals all left traces behind them, paths in time. If they ever traveled through a particular place, Rigg could tell where they had gone. It was not something he saw with his eyes&#x2014;his eyes could be closed or covered, or there could be walls or solid rock between him and a path, and he would still know where it was, and could figure out what kind of creature made it, and how long ago.<br> <br>There had been no human traffic at this stream in ten thousand years. More tellingly, few animals had come there, and no large ones.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s poisonous,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that a guess?&#x201d; asked his sister, Param, &#x201c;or do you know somehow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Even animals don&#x2019;t come here to drink,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;And no human for a long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long?&#x201d; asked Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know?&#x201d; asked Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m curious about what you know,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;I have not known a human who can do what you can do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nearly as long as since the beginning of human settlement on this world.&#x201d; Rigg had a very clear idea of what paths that old were like, since he had just crossed through the Wall between his home wallfold and this one, by clinging to an animal that, in the original stream of time, had died in the holocaust of humans&#x2019; first coming to the planet Garden.<br> <br>&#x201c;That is off by only a little less than a thousand years,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;I said &#x2018;nearly,&#x2019;&#x201d; answered Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;A thousand years this way or that,&#x201d; said Param. &#x201c;Close enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rigg still didn&#x2019;t know Param well enough to tell if her sarcasm was friendly teasing or open scorn. &#x201c;What kind of poison?&#x201d; he asked Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;A parasite,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;It can live out its entire lifecycle in the stream feeding off the bodies of its siblings, ancestors, and descendants, until one of them eats it. But if a larger animal comes to drink, it attaches to the face and immediately sends tendrils into the brain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It eats brains?&#x201d; asked Umbo, intrigued.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;It infiltrates them. It echoes the neural network. It takes over and controls the host&#x2019;s behavior.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why in the world would our ancestors bring along such a creature when they came from Earth?&#x201d; asked Umbo.<br> <br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Olivenko.<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you know that?&#x201d; asked Loaf. His tone showed he was still skeptical of Olivenko, who was only a member of the city guard in Aressa Sessamo, rather than a real soldier.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because if they had, it would exist in every wallfold,&#x201d; said Olivenko, &#x201c;and it doesn&#x2019;t exist in ours.&#x201d;<br> <br>Olivenko thinks the way Father taught me, thought Rigg. Don&#x2019;t assume: Think it through.<br> <br>Vadesh was nodding. &#x201c;A very tough little creature, the facemask.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Facemask?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What the humans of this wallfold named it. For reasons that would have become tragically obvious if you had bent over to drink from the stream.&#x201d;<br> <br>Something didn&#x2019;t ring true about this. &#x201c;How can a creature that evolved on Garden successfully take over the brains of creatures from Earth?&#x201d; asked Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say it was successful,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;And you are now as close as is safe. To avoid picking up facemasks from the wet ground beside the stream&#x2014;they can attach to any skin and migrate up your body&#x2014;you should follow in my footsteps exactly.&#x201d;<br> <br>They followed him in single file through the grass, with Rigg bringing up the rear. The path Vadesh took them on was the highest ground. Each time they reached a damp patch they jumped over it. The rill was narrow here. No one had trouble overleaping it.<br> <br>Only when they got to higher ground several rods beyond the rill was Rigg able to continue the conversation. &#x201c;If the parasite wasn&#x2019;t successful, why is it still alive here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The parasite is successful in attaching to humans and Earthborn beasts of all kinds,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not really how we measure success in a parasite. If the parasite kills its host too quickly, for instance, before the parasite can spread to new hosts, then it has failed. The goal of a parasite is like that of any other life form&#x2014;to survive and reproduce.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So these facemasks kill too quickly?&#x201d; asked Umbo, shuddering.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;I said &#x2018;for instance.&#x2019;&#x201d; He smiled at Rigg, because they both knew he was echoing Rigg&#x2019;s earlier testy reply when Vadesh told him his time estimate was off by a millennium.<br> <br>&#x201c;So in what way did this parasite fail?&#x201d; asked Rigg&#x2014;the way he would have pushed Father, an attitude that came easily to him, since not just in face and voice but in evasiveness, smugness, and assumption of authority this expendable was identical to the one that had taken Rigg as an infant from the royal house and raised him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think that with native species,&#x201d; said Vadesh, &#x201c;the parasite rode them lightly. Cooperating with them. Perhaps even helping them survive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But not with humans?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The only part of the earthborn brain it could control was the wild, competitive beast, bent on reproduction at any cost.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That sounds like soldiers on leave,&#x201d; said Loaf.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or academics,&#x201d; said Olivenko.<br> <br>Vadesh said nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;It sounds like chaos,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;You were there from the beginning, weren&#x2019;t you, Vadesh? How long did it take people to learn of the danger?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It took some time for the facemasks to emerge from their chrysalises after the disaster of the human landing,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;And still longer for the people of Vadeshfold to discover that facemasks could infest humans as well as cattle and sheep.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The herders never got infected?&#x201d; asked Loaf.<br> <br>&#x201c;It took time for a strain of facemasks to develop that could thrive on the human body. So at first it was like a pesky fungal infection.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And then it wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;Facemasks are that adaptable?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not blind adaptation,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re a clever, fascinating little creature, not exactly intelligent, but not completely stupid, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>For the first time, it occurred to Rigg that Vadesh was not just fascinated by the facemasks, but enamored of them.<br> <br>&#x201c;They can only attach to their host in the water,&#x201d; said Vadesh, answering a question no one had asked. &#x201c;And once they attach to an air-breather, they lose the ability to breathe in water. They only get their oxygen from the blood. You know what oxygen is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The breathable part of air,&#x201d; said Umbo impatiently. Olivenko chuckled. Of course, thought Rigg&#x2014;Olivenko was a scholar, and Umbo had studied for a time with Rigg&#x2019;s father.<br> <br>But Rigg noticed that Loaf and Param seemed to have no idea what Vadesh meant. How could air be divided in parts? Rigg remembered asking Father exactly that question. But there was no point in explaining the point now or soon or, probably, ever. Why would a soldier-turned-innkeeper and a royal heiress who had fled her throne require a knowledge of the elements, of the behavior of gases and fluids?<br> <br>Then again, Rigg had thought, all through his years of education, tramping with Father through the woods, that he would never need anything Father taught him except how to trap, dress, and skin their prey. Only when Father&#x2019;s death sent Rigg out in the world did he learn why Father had trained him in languages, economics, finance, law, and so many other subjects, all of which had proven vital to his survival.<br> <br>So Rigg started to explain that invisible air was really made of tiny particles of several different types. Loaf looked skeptical and Param bored, and Rigg decided that their education wasn&#x2019;t his job.<br> <br>He fell silent and thought about parasites that could only attach to humans in water, and then they lost the ability to breathe on their own. Rigg filed the information away in his mind, the way Father had taught him to do with all seemingly useless information, so he could recall it whenever Father decided to test him.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve been on my own for a year, thought Rigg, and still in my thoughts he&#x2019;s always there, my pretended father, my kidnapper for all I know. He&#x2019;s the puppeteer who, even dead, is pulling all the strings inside my mind.<br> <br>Lost in such thoughts, Rigg did not notice the first building that came in sight. It was Loaf, ever alert as a soldier should be, who saw the glint of metal. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like the Tower of O,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>It was indeed, in that it was tall and of a similar substance. But it did not rise to a point and was not rounded like a cylinder. And there were several of them nearby, and none of them was half so tall as the Tower of O.<br> <br>But they were impressive nonetheless, and tall enough that it took two more hours of walking after they first saw them for their little group to come close enough to see that these towers were made from the same material, and formed the skyline of a city.<br> <br>&#x201c;How could they build with this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. substance?&#x201d; asked Loaf. &#x201c;People have tried to cut into the Tower of O many times over the years, and neither tool nor fire can affect it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who would try to damage it?&#x201d; asked Umbo.<br> <br>&#x201c;Conquerors who want to show their power,&#x201d; said Olivenko. &#x201c;Rigg&#x2019;s and Param&#x2019;s people arose only lately. The Tower has been there ten thousand years.&#x201d;<br> <br>The talk of duration made Rigg realize something he should have noticed at once, as soon as they knew it was a city they were coming to. There were human paths again, as there had not been near the stream, but all of them were old. None more recent than ten thousand years.<br> <br>&#x201c;How long has this city been abandoned?&#x201d; asked Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t abandoned,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;There hasn&#x2019;t been a human being here for a long time,&#x201d; said Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve been here,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re not a human being, Rigg wanted to say. You&#x2019;re a machine; you leave no path. A place that contains only you is uninhabited. But it seemed too rude to say aloud. Rigg saw the absurdity of his attitude: If he truly thought of Vadesh as only a machine, rudeness would not be an issue.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did the people go?&#x201d; asked Param.<br> <br>&#x201c;People come and go in the world, and where there once were cities there are only ruins, and where once there was nothing, cities rise,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>Rigg noticed how nonresponsive Vadesh&#x2019;s answer was, but did not challenge him. Rigg trusted Vadesh too little to want him to know he wasn&#x2019;t trusted.<br> <br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s water here?&#x201d; asked Loaf. &#x201c;Because my need for it is getting pretty urgent.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you field soldiers drank your own piss,&#x201d; said Olivenko.<br> <br>&#x201c;We do pee into canteens,&#x201d; said Loaf. &#x201c;But only so we can bring it back for the officers of the city guard to drink.&#x201d;<br> <br>It could have been a quarrel, but to Rigg&#x2019;s relief, Olivenko just smiled and Umbo laughed and it went nowhere. Why did they still irritate each other so much, after all they had been through together? When would rivals become comrades?<br> <br>So all the people of this city were gone. Rigg began to scan for the paths that would show a great migration out of the city, but before he could make much progress, Vadesh led them into a low building of ordinary stone, which showed its many centuries of weathering.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did someone live here?&#x201d; asked Umbo.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a factory,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did all the people sit to work?&#x201d; asked Olivenko.<br> <br>&#x201c;A mechanical factory,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;And most of it is underground. I still use it, when I need any of the things the factory makes. But they needed safe water for the supervisors and mechanics, and for the people who hauled things in and hauled things out.&#x201d; He led them through a doorway into a dark chamber. As they passed through the door after him, a bright light came from above. The whole ceiling was aglow, very much like the lights inside the Tower of O.<br> <br>The others gasped in awe, but Rigg was noticing that the paths of humans into this chamber were few and ancient. This building had only been used for a few decades at the most. It had been abandoned by the same generation of people who had built it.<br> <br>Vadesh touched the front of a thick stone pillar and at once they heard the sound of running water inside the pillar. Then he touched another place, and a portion of the pillar came away in his hand. It was a stone vessel halfway between a drinking mug and a waterbucket in size. He handed it to Loaf. &#x201c;Because your need was so urgent,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it safe?&#x201d; asked Rigg.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s filtered through stone. No parasites of any kind can possibly get into this water.&#x201d;<br> <br>Again, Rigg noticed that while Vadesh answered, he only answered about the likelihood of parasite infestation, not the actual question Rigg had asked.<br> <br>Loaf handed the water to Param without tasting it. &#x201c;You need this most,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m a frail princess?&#x201d; Param asked with a hint of resentment.<br> <br>Well, she was physically frail and she was a princess. Until their mother tried to kill her and Rigg, she was assumed to be heir to the Tent of Light. Years of living in the narrow bounds of captivity had made her physically weak, and the journey to the Wall had only improved her stamina by a little. But no one was rude enough to point this out to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You need it most because you and Umbo lived on your water for an extra week that we didn&#x2019;t live through,&#x201d; said Loaf.<br> <br>Param took the water and drank. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It tastes fresh, and nothing else. Except a tinge of something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Trace metals,&#x201d; said Vadesh. &#x201c;From the rock it filtered through.&#x201d;<br> <br>Umbo drank next. He tried to pass it to Rigg, but Rigg would not take any until Loaf and Olivenko had also drunk.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s plenty,&#x201d; said Vadesh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then finish it, Loaf,&#x201d; said Rigg. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drink from the second serving.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He thinks I spit in it,&#x201d; said Umbo.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; said Loaf. &#x201c;You usually do.&#x201d; Then Loaf drank it off. &#x201c;Delicious,&#x201d; he said, as he handed the empty vessel to Vadesh for refilling.<br> <br>Rigg did not know why he did not trust Vadesh. This expendable had no mannerisms that were not identical to those of Rigg&#x2019;s father. Perhaps that was the cause of his suspicions. But he was sure that Vadesh was deceptive and dangerous, not because he deflected questions and clearly had his own agenda&#x2014;those were Father&#x2019;s constant attributes as well&#x2014;but because of which questions he wouldn&#x2019;t answer.<br> <br>Father would have told me why the people were gone from this...</p><h2>Endless Knight (The Arcana Chronicles)</h2><p>In this seductive follow-up to <i>Poison Princess</i>, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Kresley Cole takes us deeper into the dark world of the Arcana Chronicles.<br><br><i><b>Shocking secrets</b></i><br> <br>Evie has fully come into her powers as the Tarot Empress, and Jack was there to see it all.

Just as I once predicted.<br> <br>With that one gesture, he has broken my heart utterly.<br> <br>&#x2014;And yet I could not be prouder, Empress&#x2014; seductive Death whispered in my mind.<br> <br>I heard him so clearly; he must be close. I had nothing left to lose, no reason to live in fear of him. Watch your six, Reaper, I&#x2019;m on the hunt.<br> <br>A rasping chuckle. &#x2014;Your Death awaits.&#x2014;<br> <br>I started laughing, and I couldn&#x2019;t stop.<br> <br>Jackson paled even more. I hoped he would desert me now and take the other three with him, out of my reach.<br> <br>Because otherwise, the Empress might just kill them all&#x2014;<br> <br>Moisture tracked down my face. A tear?<br> <br>Rain.<br> <br>As Jackson and I stared at each other, drops began to fall between us.<br> <br>My laughter died when I saw him clutching my hair ribbon so tightly that his battered knuckles were white&#x2014;as if by holding on to it, he could hold on to the sweet girl he thought he&#x2019;d known.<br> <br>She was gone, replaced by the Empress, still tensed to fight, standing in a puddle of the Alchemist&#x2019;s remains. As my reddened hair streamed over my cheeks, I felt my face twisting into an expression I&#x2019;d never made before. One of menace.<br> <br>I was half-surprised Jackson hadn&#x2019;t drawn on me, but his deadly crossbow was still slung over his shoulder.<br> <br>Along with the ominous drizzle, fog began rolling into this ghost town, obscuring everything, but I spied movement out of the corner of my eye. I dragged my gaze away from Jackson to the rest of our ragtag group, three other Arcana like myself.<br> <br>Selena, Matthew, and Finn.<br> <br>It was Selena I focused on. She&#x2019;d removed her bow from her back and was now slipping an arrow from her thigh quiver.<br> <br>I raised my brows with surprise. I supposed the Archer had finally gotten tired of waiting to kill us.<br> <br>When she nocked that arrow, the whirling thorn tornado above me tightened. The little vine by my face straightened in her direction, a viper poised to strike.<br> <br>&#x201c;So that&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s going to be, Archer?&#x201d; My voice was raw from screaming in pain. I sounded like a movie villainess. I felt like one too. There&#x2019;s a heat in battle&#x2014;just as Matthew had told me. &#x201c;Do we do this now?&#x201d; Exhaustion was setting in as my body regenerated. Though the Alchemist&#x2019;s acid grenades had eaten away part of my clothes&#x2014;and skin&#x2014;I still had some fight left in me.<br> <br>But for how long?<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa, ladies, what&#x2019;s going down here?&#x201d; Finn asked in his SoCal surfer accent. &#x201c;Selena, why in the hell are you drawing on Evie?&#x201d;<br> <br>Matthew murmured, &#x201c;The Moon rises. The Moon sets.&#x201d;<br> <br>Selena ignored both boys. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to hurt you, Evie,&#x201d; she said, even as she aimed at me. Her flawless skin glowed, tinged with red like a hunter&#x2019;s moon. Her long hair streamed around her face, silvery blond, the color of moonlight. &#x201c;But I will protect myself until you rein this back in.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve remembered what we&#x2019;re meant to do, Selena.&#x201d; Kill each other. &#x201c;Give me one reason why I shouldn&#x2019;t end you right now.&#x201d; I waved to the two huge oaks I&#x2019;d revived earlier. Behind her, the ground rumbled as their roots snaked closer, readying to drag her into the earth.<br> <br>My soldiers awaiting my order. It would be a horrific way to go.<br> <br>&#x201c;You need me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You and I&#x2014;along with some other cards&#x2014;will ally to kill Death. He&#x2019;s too strong for any one of us to take out alone. We work together until we defeat him. Then all bets are off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if I say no?&#x201d;<br> <br>She drew back on her bowstring.<br> <br>The glyphs winding along my skin burned brighter with aggression. &#x201c;Shoot me, Selena. I want you to. I&#x2019;ll just regenerate, and I&#x2019;ll bury you.&#x201d; Big talk, considering I was weakening by the second. My soldiers as well.<br> <br>Selena chanced a glance over her shoulder. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time for this right now! Bagmen are coming, more than I&#x2019;ve ever seen together.&#x201d; No night after the apocalypse was complete without those bloodthirsty zombies. &#x201c;But J.D.&#x201d;&#x2014;she jerked her chin at Jackson&#x2014;&#x201c;and I only have a few arrows between us. We had to steal a jeep from that militia to get here. Let&#x2019;s just say they didn&#x2019;t give it up easily.&#x201d;<br> <br>I could hear the Bagmen&#x2019;s bloodcurdling wails somewhere out in the night. Like counting seconds between a lightning strike and thunder, I figured they were some distance away.<br> <br>But it also sounded like tons of them.<br> <br>&#x201c;On top of that, other cards have been on our trail for a day,&#x201d; Selena continued. &#x201c;By now they know you offed an Arcana&#x2014;the Alchemist&#x2019;s death will draw them here. Soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackson gazed back and forth between me and Selena. Fifteen minutes ago, he&#x2019;d thought we were two somewhat normal girls&#x2014;or as normal as we could be A.F., after the Flash.<br> <br>Now we were talking about killing each other, killing a card named Death. While a thorn tornado swirled above us. Not to mention that Jackson had seen the Alchemist&#x2019;s remains, and knew I&#x2019;d ripped a teenager to pieces.<br> <br>Selena eased up a fraction on her bowstring. &#x201c;We need to call a truce for the night and get as far away as possible.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A truce&#x2014;there we go, good idea!&#x201d; Finn said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get on the road and talk this out. Evie, tell me you have my truck.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Out of gas.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit. Ours, too. Looks like we&#x2019;re on foot.&#x201d;<br> <br>No reaction from Jackson.

The county of Norfolk is not so populous that they could have avoided each other. Their conduct at these meetings had been shaped by Ginny's lofty and willful ignorance of the situation: by Emma's sangfroid: by Felix's natural desire to maintain an arrangement that suited him.Over the years they had coincided in drafty parish halls, in charity committee rooms, and at the caucuses of local groups concerned with the protection of what, in the decade just beginning, would be known as "the environment." They had bumped into each other in Norwich, shopping in Jarrold's department store; they had exchanged small talk at exhibitions of craftwork, and occupied neighboring seats at the theater.Once, traveling to London, they had found themselves sole occupants of a first-class carriage. For half an hour they had found enough that was anodyne to pass the time. Then Ginny, excusing herself with a smile, delved into her bag and pulled out a fat paperback book. She retired behind it. Emma examined its cover. A svelte woman, with a small crown perched upon her wimple, stoodbefore a manor house with anachronistic chimney stacks. The title was in florid gold script: <i>Wyfe to Crookback.</i> Emma looked out of the window. The landscape was a sad East England green; crows wheeled over the fields. As they moved from the edge of England to its heart, Emma herself took out a book.They parted at sooty Liverpool Street with a nod and a smile. London forced no collusion on them, but Norfolk did. A handful of farming and professional families played host to both. At a round of weddings and christenings they had made polite, even warm conversation. At a dozen New Year's Eve parties they had wished each other luck and happiness: and sometimes almost meant it.Now, on this February morning, Ginny stood surrounded by a knot of mourners. Friends and business associates had turned out for the occasion; Felix had been well liked in the district. The church occupied high ground, and a ripping wind billowed coats and snapped at woolen head scarves and brought a flush to aching faces. The mourners could sense the presence of the sea, hidden from them by a belt of pines.Some of them lingered in the church porch, reading the notices about flower rotas, dusting, and brass cleaning; others stood among the gravestones, looking depressed. They had double-parked in the open area beyond the church gate, and would have to wait their turn to get away. Ginny, leaning on the arm of her son, moved from group to group, offering a few tactful words to soothe their feelings; she understood that death is embarrassing.Her own family--her son, Daniel, who was an architect, her daughter, Claire, who was a buyer at Harrods--had been as gentle and as careful of her feelings as anyone could wish. But--even as she deferred the moment--Ginny felt that it was Emma to whom she wished to speak, to whom naturally she should be speaking. Patting her son's arm, smiling up and dismissing him, she made her way across the grass with a short, precisely regulated stride, her high heels spiking holes in the ground like some primitive seed drill.Ginny Palmer was a sharp, neat, Wallis Simpson sort of woman, to whom black lent an added definition. As she advanced onEmma, she took from her pocket a crisp lace-edged handkerchief, folded it very small and polished the tip of her nose: a gesture quite unnecessary, but somehow drawn out of her by the occasion. You see me, the widow: fastidious but distraught.Emma Eldred kept her hands in her pockets; she had forgotten her gloves. She wore the coat that she had worn for years, to go out on her doctor's rounds, to go shopping, to go out walking, and to meet Felix. She saw no need for any other coat, in her ordinary life or on a day like this; it was dark, it was decent, and--she felt obscurely--it was something Felix would have recognized.Emma Eldred was not a large woman, but gave the appearance of it: forty-eight years old, her face innocent of cosmetics, her broad feet safely encased in scuffed shoes decorated by leather tassels which somehow failed to cut a dash. Emma had known Ginny's husband since childhood. She might have married him; but Felix was not what Emma considered a serious man. Their relationship had, she felt, borne all the weight it could. As Ginny approached, Emma shrunk into herself, inwardly but not outwardly. A stranger, only partly apprised of the situation, would have taken Ginny for the smart little mistress, and Emma for the tatty old wife.The women stood together for a moment, not speaking; then as the wind cut her to the bird bones, Ginny took a half step closer, and stood holding her mink collar up to her throat. "Well, Ginny," Emma said, after a moment. "I'm not here to act as a windbreak." She drew her right hand from her pocket, and gave Ginny a pat on the shoulder. It was a brusque gesture, less of consolation than of encouragement; what you might give a weary nag, as it faces the next set of hurdles.Ginny averted her face. Tears sprang into her eyes. She took out her tiny handkerchief again. "Why, Emma?" she said. She sounded fretful, but as if her fretfulness might turn to rage. "Tell me why. You're a doctor.""But not his doctor.""He wasn't ill. He never had a day's illness."Emma fixed her gaze on the tassels of her shoes. She imaginedherself looking right through her dead lover; through his customary tweed jacket, his lambswool pullover, his striped shirt, through the skin, through the flesh, into the arteries where Felix's blood moved slowly, a dark underground stream with silted banks. "No one could have known," she said. "No one could have spared you this shock, Ginny. Will you be all right, my dear?""There's plenty of insurance," Ginny said. "And the house. I'll move of course. But not just yet.""Don't do anything in a hurry," Emma said. She had meant her question in a broad sense, not as an inquiry into Ginny's financial standing. She raised her head, and saw that they were being watched. The eyes of the other mourners were drawn to them, however hard those mourners tried to look away. What do they all think, Emma wondered: that there will be some sort of embarrassing scene? Hardly likely. Not at this time. Not in this place. Not among people like ourselves, who have been reared in the service of the great god Self-Control. "Ginny," she said, "you mustn't stand about here. Let Daniel drive you home.""A few people are coming back," Ginny said. She looked at Emma in faint surprise, as if it were natural that she would know the arrangements. "You should come back too. Let me give you some whiskey. A freezing day like this ... Still, better than rain. Claire's staying on over the weekend." Ginny raised her hand, and twitched at her collar again. "Emma, I'd like to see you. Like you to come to the house ... Mrs. Gleave is making vol-au-vents ..." Her voice tailed off entirely.Emma's brother, Ralph Eldred, loomed purposefully behind them: a solid figure, hands scrunched into the pockets of his dark wool overcoat. Ginny looked up. The sight of Ralph seemed to restore her. "Ralph, thank you for coming," she said. "Come back with us and have some whiskey.""I should take myself off," Ralph said. "I have to go to Norwich this afternoon to a meeting. But naturally if you want me to, Ginny ... if I can be of any help ..." He was weighing considerations,as he always did; his presence was wanted on every hand, and it was simply a question of where he was needed most."Why, no," Ginny said. "It was a courtesy, Ralph. Do run along."She managed a smile. It was her husband's underoccupation that had freed him for his long years of infidelity; but Ralph's days were full, and everybody knew it. There were advantages, she saw, in being married to a man who thought only of work, God, and family; even though the Eldred children did look so down-at-heel, and had been so strangely brought up, and even though Ralph's wife was worn to a shadow slaving for his concerns.Ralph's wife Anna wore a neat black pillbox hat. It looked very smart, though it was not remotely in fashion. Lingering in the background, she gave Ginny a nod of acknowledgment and sympathy. It was an Anna Eldred nod, full of I-do-not-intrude. Ginny returned it; then Ralph took his wife's arm, and squired her away at a good clip toward their parked car.Ginny looked after them. "You wonder about marriage," she said suddenly. "Are marriages all different, or all alike?"Emma shrugged, shoulders stiff inside her old coat. "No use asking me, Ginny."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Inside the car, Ralph said, "It's not right, you know. It's not, is it? For Emma to find out like that. More or less by chance. And only when it was all over.""It was all over very quickly," Anna said. "From what I gather.""Yes, but to have no priority in being told--""I expect you think Ginny should have rung her from the hospital, do you? Just given her a tinkle from the intensive care unit?""--to have no right to know. That's what galls me. It's inhuman. And now Ginny gets all the sympathy, all the attention. I'm not saying she doesn't need and deserve it. But Emma gets nothing, not a word. Only this public embarrassment.""I see--you think that as Emma was the <i>ma�tresse en titre,</i> she should be allowed to put on a show of her own?" Anna sighed. "I'm sure Felix has left her some fine diamonds, and a chateau for her old age."A contractor's van drew up in front of the Eldreds' car, adding to the traffic jam; restoration work was going on at the church. Two workmen got out, and began to untie a ladder from the roofrack. A lesser man with Ralph's schedule would have fretted at the delay. But Ralph showed his impatience only by a little tapping of his forefinger against the steering wheel. There was a school nearby, and the voices of children drifted from the playground, carried on the wind like gulls' cries.The couple who blocked them drove off, nodding, raising hands in a stiff-fingered wave. The contractor moved his van. Ralph pulled out onto the road. Anna saw the children dashing and bumping and careening behind a fence: bullets trussed in duffle coats, their faces hidden under hoods.The route home lay inland, through narrow lanes between farms; flat airy fields, where tractors lay at rest. Ralph pulled up to let a duck dawdle across the road, on its way from a barnyard to nowhere. "I'll tell you," he said. "I'll tell you what's the worst of it. Emma's got nothing. Nothing. She's given twenty years to Felix and now she's on her own.""Emma's given something," Anna said. "I think to say that she's given twenty years is being melodramatic.""Why is it," Ralph said, "that women manage to be so cool in these situations? What's all this keeping up a good front? Why do they think they have to do it? I heard Ginny talking about <i>insurance policies,</i> for God's sake.""I only mean, that Emma's life has suited her. She had what she wanted--a part-time man. Felix didn't use her. The reverse, I think. She could have married. If she'd chosen to. She didn't have to wait on Felix.""Married? Could she?" Ralph turned his head."Look out," Anna said, with a languor born of experience.Ralph put his foot on the brake; a farm truck slowly extruded its back end from a muddy and half-concealed driveway."Sorry," Ralph said. "Could she? Who could she have married then?""Oh Ralph, I don't mean any one person, not this particular man or that particular man ... I only mean that if she had wanted to marry, if that had been what she preferred, she could have done it. But marriage entails things, like learning to boil eggs. Things that are beyond Emma.""I can't see men beating a path to her door." Ralph edged the car painfully down the lane, squeezing it past the truck, which had got stuck. "Not Emma. No beauty.""Felix liked her.""Felix was a creature of habit.""Most men are."Ralph fell silent. He was very fond of his sister; no one should think otherwise. Emma was kind, clever, wise ... and lonely, he'd supposed: a little figure glimpsed on a river bank, while the pleasure craft sped by. This notion of her as a manipulator, of Felix as a little fish that she played at the end of her stick and hook ... Seems unlikely to me, he thought. But then, what do I know?The journey took them a half hour, through back roads and lanes, through straggling hamlets of red brick or flint cottages, whose only amenity was a postbox; between agribusiness fields, wide open to a vast gray sky. Ralph pulled up with a jolt at the gate of their house. Anna shot forward, one hand on the dashboard and one on her hat. "Can I leave you here? I'm late."As she unraveled her seat belt, Ralph turned to look at her. "Those people at the funeral, all those friends of Felix's, how many of them do you think knew about him and Emma?"Anna took her house keys from her bag. "Every one of them.""How did Ginny bear it?""Easily. Or so everyone says." Anna swung her door open and her legs out, setting her high heels daintily into the mud. "What time will you be back?""Seven o'clock. Maybe eight."Nine, then, Anna thought. "Everybody knew except you," she said. "I suppose you still feel a fool.""I suppose I do." Ralph reached over to close the passenger door. "But then, I still don't see why I should have known. Not as if their affair was the flamboyant sort. Not as if it was ..."--he searched for the word--" ... torrid."Torrid, Anna thought. She watched him drive away. Interesting how our vocabulary responds, providing us with words we have never needed before, words stacked away for us, neatly folded into our brain and there for our use: like a bride's lifetime supply of linen, or a ducal trove of monogrammed china.

No other profession looks so inoffensive but is in fact so dangerous to the status quo. Their weapon? A gospel that is profoundly countercultural. But standing firm in today's world isn't easy. Powerful forces, both subtle and obvious, attempt to domesticate pastors, to make them, in a word, unnecessary.<br><br>In this book, two of today's most respected authors help pastors recover their gospel identity and maintain a pure vision of Christian leadership. Marva Dawn and Eugene Peterson reconnect pastors with the biblical texts that will train them as countercultural servants of the gospel. Marva Dawn looks to Paul's letter to the Ephesians for instruction for churches seeking to live faithfully in today's world. In turn, Eugene Peterson explores Romans, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus, drawing from them the correct view of pastoral identity.<br><br></p><p>Marva J.

A scholar with four masters degrees and aPh.D. in Christian Ethics and the Scriptures from theUniversity of Notre Dame, Dr. Dawn has spoken for clergyand worship conferences and seminaries throughout NorthAmerica and in Madagascar and in Eastern and WesternEurope.

If you have enjoyed previous works by Dawn and/or Peterson, you will enjoy this book as well. It is a book that draws pastors, especially closer to God and encourages us to rely more fully on his grace."<br><br><b>Provident Book Finder</b><br> "This is a rich book with much to assist both pastors and laypersons in shaping their biblical identity as countercultural servants of Jesus Christ."<br><br><b>Christian Retailing</b><br> "The book's premise is that there are three ways that pastors are unnecessary: to what the culture presumes is important, to what pastors themselves feel is essential and to what congregations insist that pastors must do and be.&nbsp;<i>The Unnecessary Pastor</i>&nbsp;should liberate ministers from such manmade limitations and free them to become what God has called them to be. It's likely not only to be popular with clergy, but also clergy-to-be, as seminarians could definitely benefit from its godly insights."<br><br><b>Leadership</b><br> "Peterson and Dawn's book is a path back to the altar of honesty. Dawn and Petersen have come to set us free of our addictions to self-importance. It has always been better to be needy than necessary. Their book rightly teaches us that we are unnecessary. When we doubt it, we are irrelevant as well."</p><h2>Duplex: A Novel</h2><p><p>"Utterly compelling . . .

Her notes also give guidance to the literary and historical allusions that pepper Persius's and Juvenal's satirical poems--which were clearly aimed at a sophisticated urban audience. Both poets adopt the mask of an angry man, and sharp criticism of the society in which they live is combined with flashes of sardonic humor in their satires. Whether targeting common and uncommon vices, the foolishness of prayers, the abuse of power by emperors and the Roman elite, the folly and depravity of Roman wives, or decadence, materialism, and corruption, their tone is generally one of righteous indignation.</p><p>Juvenal and Persius are seminal as well as stellar figures in the history of satirical writing. Juvenal especially had a lasting influence on English writers of the Renaissance and succeeding centuries.</p></p><p><p>Susanna Morton Braund is Professor of Latin Poetry and its Reception at the University of British Columbia.</p>&#x201c;It is a pleasure to see that nowadays acclaimed specialists take honour in preparing editions for the Loeb Classical Library. S. Braund has greatly advanced the study of Roman satirists with a number of important articles and monographs...So her name as the editor of this volume is more or less a warrant for the highest possible quality. The introduction is, in a word, magnificent: in merely 39 Loeb pages, S. Braund manages to give a broad, relevant overview of the whole genre, its origins and earliest representatives, while also setting the tone for a more modern approach of Roman satire as a genre in which the poet creates satiric mouthpieces (personae), who play a specific, exaggerated role rather than voicing the author's personal views. Persius and Juvenal are also presented, in 12 succinct but very helpful pages...The text reads as smoothly and easily as if it had been written without any special effort--mostly a mark of excellence and a sign of meticulous work...The texts of Persius and Juvenal are, no doubt, the most important part of the book. And here too, everything is truly excellent. Every text is preceded by a short introductory paragraph, setting out the general outline of the poem and adding some cautious general remarks about its aims and style...In her prose translation, S. Braund has consciously and explicitly avoided both old fashioned words (to mention one example, she even objects to 'therefore') and trendy idiom: the book is intended 'for a long shelf life' (p.vii). She has succeeded remarkably well in her task...So is there anything in this book that is less than perfect? Hardly, I would say...This volume is a truly great achievement, a most welcome addition to the Loeb Classical Library, and a must-buy for all institutional and private libraries of Latin literature.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Vincent Hunink</b><b>, </b><b><i>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</i></b></p><h2>Yertle the Turtle (Classic Seuss)</h2><p>Three modern fables in humorous pictures and verse.</p><p>Yet more wisdom cast down from high atop Mt. Seuss, this cheerful trio of tales teaches some valuable lessons in humility--thanks to a sharp-eyed worm, a bragging bear and rabbit, a fuzzy-tailed bird, and a couple hundred turtles led by their foolish King Yertle.<p> Yertle's story leads off with his attempt to build a bigger kingdom on the backs of his loyal subjects (literally). King of everything he can see, Yertle orders his turtles to stack up under him to build a towering throne. ("He made each turtle stand on another one's back and he piled them all up in a nine-turtle stack.") But a plain little turtle named Mack--stuck at the bottom--decides he's had enough. ("I know up on top you are seeing great sights, but down on the bottom we, too, should have rights!")</p><p> Following Yertle's downfall, a whiny girl-bird named Gertrude McFuzz wishes she had <i>two</i> feathers, just like Miss Lolla-Lee-Lou: "One droopy-droop feather. That's all that she had. And, oh! That one feather made Gertrude so sad." But even when Gertrude gets her wish--and then some--she finds that vanity has its price. Meanwhile, in "The Big Brag," a proud rabbit and an even-prouder bear duke it out in a battle of the senses, arguing over who's the best of the beasts, only to get their clever comeuppance from a wild-eyed little worm.

It is the time of the gloaming, the owl-light. Out in the wood, the resident tawny has started calling, Hoo-hoo-hoo-h-o-o-o .&#39; There is something about owls. They feature in every major culture from the Stone Age onwards. They are creatures of the night, and thus of magic. They are the birds of ill-tidings, the avian messengers from the Other Side. But owls - with the sapient flatness of their faces, their big, round eyes, their paternal expressions - are also reassuringly familiar. We see them as wise, like Athena&#39;s owl, and loyal, like Harry Potter&#39;s Hedwig. Human-like, in other words. No other species has so captivated us. In The Secret Life of the Owl , John Lewis-Stempel explores the legends and history of the owl.

The great detective Sherlock Holmes knows that there must be a more rational explanation, but the difficulty is to find it before the hellhound finds him.</p><p>We owe 1902's <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher "Bobbles" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's "a real Creeper!" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. "The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul," Watson realizes. "Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths."

Now Mighty Casey has been brought to life by celebrated illustrator C. F. Payne, who captures the old-fashioned fun of an afternoon at the ballpark for a brand-new generation.</p><p>C. F. Payne has illustrated more than a dozen picture books, including the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling <i>Mousetronaut </i>by astronaut Mark Kelly, the Texas Bluebonnet winner <i>Shoeless Joe &amp; Black Betsy</i>, written by Phil Bildner, and the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Remarkable Farkle McBride</i> and <i>Micawber</i>, both by John Lithgow. He teaches at the Columbus College of Design, where he is the chair of the Illustration Department. Payne lives with his wife and children in Cincinnati, Ohio. Visit him online at CFPayne.com.Kindergarten-Grade 5-Payne's caricatures, rendered in a mix of acrylics, watercolor, ink, oils, and colored pencils, are a marvel of texture and personality. Casey himself is the picture of pride-massive upper body, toothpick ankles, rosy cheeks, enormous sideburns, and a handlebar mustache. He's the essence of nonchalance as he steps up to the plate, acknowledging his adoring fans. Payne alternates panoramic spreads with single scenes facing a white page comprised of a stanza and visual detail. At the climax, an extreme close-up of "mighty Casey," smoke coming out of his ears and gums glistening, is followed by a two-page cyclone of empty air consuming the batter. Notes about Thayer and the poem complete the offering. Christopher Bing's version (Handprint, 2000), with its scrapbook setting, provides an elegant window to a distant event. Patricia Polacco's Casey at the Bat (PaperStar, 1997), with its youthful framing story, creates sympathy for and accessibility to a sandlot tragedy. Payne's version brings its own flavor to the classic poem. While the staging details evoke the past effectively, the humor and drama elicit immediate interest.

In every way,&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;A Most Dangerous Book is a most brilliant achievement."--Washington Post</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The riveting story of the Germania and its incarnations and exploitations through the ages.<br>The pope wanted it, Montesquieu used it, and the Nazis pilfered an Italian noble's villa to get it: the Germania, by the Roman historian Tacitus, took on a life of its own as both an object and an ideology. When Tacitus wrote a not-very-flattering little book about the ancient Germans in 98 CE, at the height of the Roman Empire, he could not have foreseen that the Nazis would extol it as "a bible," nor that Heinrich Himmler, the engineer of the Holocaust, would vow to resurrect Germany on its grounds. But the Germania inspired--and polarized--readers long before the rise of the Third Reich. In this elegant and captivating history, Christopher B. Krebs, a professor of classics at Harvard University, traces the wide-ranging influence of the Germania over a five-hundred-year span, showing us how an ancient text rose to take its place among the most dangerous books in the world. 14 black-and-white illustrations</p><p><b>Christopher B. Krebs</b>, a classics professor at Stanford University, has published widely on the Roman historians and their afterlives.Harvard classics professor Krebs writes a scholarly but lucid account of the abuse of history. Written in 98 C.E. by the Roman official Tacitus, About the Origin and Mores of the Germanic Peoples was lost for centuries but resurfaced around 1500 as Germans were growing resentful of foreign domination&#x2014;in this case from the Catholic Church in Rome. The rediscovered book launched a primitivist myth that captivated admirers over the next 500 years, from Martin Luther to Heinrich Himmler, who loved its portrayal of ancient Germans as freedom-loving warriors, uncultured but honorable, in contrast to decadent Romans. In fact, Tacitus probably never visited Germany, Krebs notes. Rather, using books and travelers' reports, he wrote for a Roman audience who shared his romantic view of northern barbarians. Enthusiastic German readers, culminating in the Nazis, ignored Tacitus's disparaging comments, misread passages to confirm their prejudices, and proclaimed that the ancient historian confirmed their national superiority. This is an inventive analysis of, and warning against, an irresistible human yearning to find written proof of one's ideology. Illus. (May) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Lerner confronts the values behind the Big Bang theory: the belief that mathematical formulae are superior to empirical observation; that the universe is finite and decaying; and that it could only come into being through some outside force. With inspiring boldness and scientific rigor, he offers a brilliantly orchestrated argument that generates explosive intellectual debate.</p><p>&#34;Lerner does a fine job poking holes in Big Bang thinking and provides a historical perspective as well, linking scientific theories to trends in philosophy, politics, religion and even economics...a most readable book.&#34; -- Chicago TribuneFrom Steven Weinberg's The First Three Minutes (Basic, 1976. o.p.; 1988. pap.) to Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time ( LJ 4/15/88), numerous science popularizations have expounded the Big Bang Theory for the origin of the universe as indisputable fact. Readers of those books will find this one startling and intriguing. Lerner, a plasma physicist, points out flaws in the Big Bang model and proposes an alternative theory: an eternal, self-sustaining "plasma" universe where electromagnetic fields within conducting gases provide other, simpler explanations for observed phenomena. His contention that the Big Bang is merely a repackaged creation myth is presumptuous, but well argued. To present a current scientific controversy to a general audience risks, on one hand, misleading the public and, on the other, circumventing the peer review process. This book, however, makes valid points in a convincing manner and does neither. Recommended for general science collections.<br><i>- Gregg Sapp, Montana State Univ.

After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941. More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold&nbsp;worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on&nbsp;PBS.<br> &nbsp;</p>PreSchool-Using illustrations from the original Curious George series (Houghton Mifflin), the publisher has produced two very nice board books, translated into a neutral and accessible Spanish appropriate for younger audiences. In Curious George and the Bunny, the lovable monkey is featured in a problem-solving story. George cannot resist approaching a cage full of bunnies and taking one out to pet. When one escapes and runs away, George must devise a way to find him and bring him back to his mother. In Curious George's Opposites, there is no story, rather a series of scenes featuring the mischievous monkey that illustrate concepts, such as up, down; in front, behind; dry, wet; and so forth.

Although he had a profound influence on the development of social philosophy, he published no books in his lifetime. This makes the lectures collected in <i>Mind, Self, and Society</i> all the more remarkable, as they offer a rare synthesis of his ideas.<br> <br> This collection gets to the heart of Mead&#x2019;s meditations on social psychology and social philosophy. Its penetrating, conversational tone transports the reader directly into Mead&#x2019;s classroom as he teases out the genesis of the self and the nature of the mind. The book captures his wry humor and shrewd reasoning, showing a man comfortable quoting Aristotle alongside <i>Alice in Wonderland.<br></i><br> Included in this edition are an insightful foreword from leading Mead scholar Hans Joas, a revealing set of textual notes by Dan Huebner that detail the text&#x2019;s origins, and a comprehensive bibliography of Mead&#x2019;s other published writings. While Mead&#x2019;s lectures inspired hundreds of students, much of his brilliance has been lost to time. This new edition ensures that Mead&#x2019;s ideas will carry on, inspiring a new generation of thinkers.</p></p><p><b>George Herbert Mead</b> (1863-1931) was an American philosopher, sociologist and psychologist, primarily affiliated with the University of Chicago, where he was one of several distinguished pragmatists.

Examples are given throughout the text, in order to motivate and illustrate the theory and show its importance for many applications in e.g. economics, biology and physics. The basic idea of the presentation is to start from some basic results (without proofs) of the easier cases and develop the theory from there, and to concentrate on the proofs of the easier case (which nevertheless are often sufficiently general for many purposes) in order to be able to reach quickly the parts of the theory which is most important for the applications. For the 6th edition the author has added further exercises and, for the first time, solutions to many of the exercises are provided. </p><p>This corrected 6th printing of the 6th edition contains additional corrections and useful improvements, based in part on helpful comments from the readers.</p></p><p><p>From the reviews of the fifth edition:</p> <p></p> <p>"This is a highly readable and refreshingly rigorous introduction to stochastic calculus. ... This is not a watered-down treatment. It is a serious introduction that starts with fundamental measure-theoretic concepts and ends, coincidentally, with the Black-Scholes formula as one of several examples of applications. This is the best single resource for learning the stochastic calculus ... ." (riskbook.com, 2002)</p> <p>From the reviews of the sixth edition:</p> <p></p> <p>"The book ... has evolved from a 200-page typewritten booklet to a modern classic. Part of its charm and success is the fact that the author does not bother too much with the (for the novice) cumbersome rigorous theory ... . This does not mean that the book is not rigorous, it is just the timing and dosage of mathematical rigour ... that is palatable for undergraduates ... . a highly readable account, suitable for self-study and for use in the classroom." (Ren� L. Schilling, The Mathematical Gazette, March, 2005)</p> <p>"This is the sixth edition of the classical and excellent book on stochastic differential equations. The main difference with the next to last edition is the addition of detailed solutions of selected exercises ... . This is certainly an excellent idea in view to test its ability of applications of the concepts ... . certainly one of the best books on the subject, it will be very helpful to any graduate students and also very valuable for any analysts of financial market." (St�phane M�tens, Physicalia, Vol. 26 (1), 2004)</p> <p>"This is now the sixth edition of the excellent book on stochastic differential equations and related topics. ... the presentation is successfully balanced between being easily accessible for a broad audience and being mathematically rigorous. The book is a first choice for courses at graduate level in applied stochastic differential equations. The inclusion of detailed solutions to many of the exercises in this edition also makes it very useful for self-study."

His holistic approach is still recognized as fundamental for graphic designers and typographers all over the world. The voume is a comprehensive masterpiece seen in its overall structure: in the themes presented, in the comparison of similarities and contrasts, in the richness of the illustrations and the harmoniously inserted types. Behind the purely pedagogic examples of exact proportions, a rich, philosophical thinking shines through. Today, fifty years after this book was first published, it is still widely used and referenced.</p><p>Text: German, English, French</p><h2>Contemplating the Trinity: The Path to the Abundant Christian Life</h2><p>Unity, joy, simplicity, beauty, truth&#x2014;these are the hallmarks of the three Persons in one God, the Trinity. In Contemplating the Trinity, Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher to the papal household, invites readers to turn to the Trinity so that they can enter into and experience the relationship of love that the divine Persons share with one another. Convinced that Christians today need a spirituality that is more clearly trinitarian, Fr. Cantalamessa draws from theology, spirituality, and art to articulate this new perspective and its implications. As readers accept Christ&#x2019;s invitation to immerse themselves in the &#x201c;bottomless sea without shores&#x201d; that is the Trinity, they will find themselves on a journey that promises a deeper understanding of how this relationship of love can be our standard for holiness.</p><p></p><h2>Handel at the Court of Kings</h2><p>With clarity and with admirable simplicity, keyed to the understanding of children, Opal Wheeler has traced the many-sided career of George Frederic Handel, whose restless nature vied always with his tremendous ability as a composer and director. Handel&#39;s strange boyhood, clouded by the fact that his father did not want him to become a musician, and the later years when, thanks to the patronage of the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, his music was played before the greatest music lovers of Europe - all of this makes absorbing reading. The selections of Handel&#39;s music included here are those best understood and most apt to be mastered by young musicians. One evening, back in 1691, conservative Doctor Handel was shocked and dismayed to find his small son carrying the torch at the head of a band of singers wandering through the little town of Halle. The good doctor never quite unde rstood the all-consuming love of music which drove his son from childhood on and on to the great heights he eventually attained as the beloved Father of the Oratorio, the composer of the magnificent MESSIAH. Opal Wheeler has given us here the most finished, most completely satisfying book on her list of fine music biographies. Handel at the Court of Kings should be a favorite of all children who love music, whether they are young musicians themselves or not.</p><p></p><h2>Lying: A Metaphorical Memoir</h2><p>In this powerful and provocative new memoir, award-winning author Lauren Slater forces readers to redraw the boundary between what we know as fact and what we believe through the creation of our own personal fictions. Mixing memoir with mendacity, Slater examines memories of her youth, when after being diagnosed with a strange illness she developed seizures and neurological disturbances-and the compulsion to lie. Openly questioning the reliability of memoir itself, Slater presents the mesmerizing story of a young woman who discovers not only what plagues her but also what cures her-the birth of her sensuality, her creativity as an artist, and storytelling as an act of healing.</p><p>One has good reason to be suspicious of a book that calls itself a "metaphorical memoir." If a metaphor substitutes one thing for another to which it's not ordinarily related, and a memoir relates the personal experiences of the author, then a metaphorical memoir would be... well, lying, if we're going to get technical about it. Or it could be <i>Lying</i>, in which case, hold that judgment and lay all categories aside: here is a book so stunningly contrary it deserves a whole genre to itself. <p> Lauren Slater may have grown up with epilepsy. Or she may have Munchausen syndrome, "also called factitious illness," also called lying. Or, quite possibly, she has never had any of the above, and all her exquisite evocations of auras and grand mal seizures are merely well-researched symbolic descriptions of her psychic state. In a chapter that's disguised as an extended letter to her editor (and impishly titled "How to Market This Book") she defends her decision to call the work nonfiction: </p><blockquote> Why is what we feel less true than what is? Supposing I simply feel like an epileptic, a spastic person, one with a shivering brain; supposing I have chosen epilepsy because it is the most accurate conduit to convey my psyche to you? Would this not still be a memoir, <i>my memoir</i>? </blockquote> Slater is peering down a slippery slope here, and for all its manifest brilliance, the pyrotechnics of its prose, reading <i>Lying</i> can be an unnerving experience--sort of like hanging out with a compulsive liar, actually. (It's no help to find out that "after all, a lot, or at least some, or at least a few, of the literal facts are accurate.")<p> But if Slater is playing with our heads, she's not doing so for fashionable postmodern reasons. <i>Lying</i>'s bag of tricks emerges from some complex and deeply felt ideas about form, reality, and consciousness itself--and what's more, it's an extraordinary memoir, "true" or not. A field full of nuns, their windblown habits tipping them over into the snow; an electric brain stimulator that makes a patient see colors and taste her own words; Slater rolling in mounds of Barbadian sugar and then running back to her mother, coated like candy--who cares whether any of these actually happened? In the end, <i>Lying</i> is fundamentally true, just as a great novel or indeed any great work of art is true: in a way that has nothing to do with fact. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>auty of Lauren Slater's prose is shocking," said Newsday about Welcome to My Country, and now, in this powerful and provocative new book, Slater brilliantly explores a mind, a body, and a life under siege. Diag-nosed as a child with a strange illness, brought up in a family given to fantasy and ambition, Lauren Slater developed seizures, auras, neurological disturbances--and an ability to lie. In <b>Lying: A Metaphorical Memoir</b>, Slater blends a coming-of-age story with an electrifying exploration of the nature of truth, and of whether it is ever possible to tell--or to know--the facts about a self, a human being, a life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><b>Lying</b> chronicles the doctors, the tests, the seizures, the family embarrassments, even as it explores a sensitive child's illness as both metaphor and a means of attention-getting--a human being's susceptibility to malady, and to storytelling as an</p><h2>Together We Are One: Honoring Our Diversity, Celebrating Our Connection</h2><p>Based on four retreats that Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh led specifically for people of color, this book is for people of all colors, backgrounds, and experiences who have ever felt excluded or alienated, or anyone concerned with issues of social justice. Although <i>Together We Are One</i> is based on teachings given to Buddhist practitioners of color, readers of all backgrounds and walks of life will find it an inspirational and practical guide.<br><br>In chapters focusing on honoring our ancestors, developing understanding and compassion, and seeing the world in terms of interbeing, Nhat Hanh shows how meditation and the practice of looking deeply can help create a sense of wholeness and connectedness with others. Chapters are interspersed with mindfulness practice exercises and the personal stories of skilled writers, such as Larry Ward (author of <i>Love&#x2019;s Garden</i>), Sr. Chan Khong (author of <i>Learning True Love</i>), and Rev. Hilda Ryumon Gutierrez Baldoquin (editor of <i>Dharma Color and Culture</i>), about their discovery of a spiritual path, their experience of finding balance, overcoming obstacles in an unpredictable world, and maintaining and sharing insights. <i>Together We Are One</i> is a valuable addition to the unique expression of Buddhism in the West.<br><br>As in all his writings, Thich Nhat Hanh does not suggest we replace traditional beliefs and customs with Buddhism, but rather emphasizes that a mindful approach to daily life and interactions can help overcome misperception and separation so that we might honor and transcend our differences. Nhat Hanh&#x2019;s primary focus highlights the basic how-to&#x2019;s of Buddhist practice, such as mindful walking and eating, the practice of Looking Deeply, and a never before published multicultural version of the Touching the Earth Ceremony, making them accessible possibilities for a better everyday life.

She was smitten, and she wasn&#x2019;t alone. This country on the Black Sea has an unusual effect on people; the most passionate rip off their clothes and drink wines out of horns while the cold-hearted well up with tears and make emotional toasts. Visiting winemakers fall under Georgia&#x2019;s spell and bring home <i>qvevris</i> (clay fermentation vessels) while rethinking their own techniques.<br> But, as in any good fairy tale, Feiring sensed that danger rode shotgun with the magic. With acclaim and growing international interest come threats in the guise of new wine consultants aimed at making wines more commercial. So Feiring fought back in the only way she knew how: by celebrating Georgia and the men and women who make the wines she loves most, those made naturally with organic viticulture, minimal intervention, and no additives.<br> From Tbilisi to Batumi, Feiring meets winemakers, bishops, farmers, artists, and silk spinners. She feasts, toasts, and collects recipes. She encounters the thriving qvevri craftspeople of the countryside, wild grape hunters, and even Stalin&#x2019;s last winemaker while plumbing the depths of this tiny country&#x2019;s love for its wines.<br><i>For the Love of Wine</i> is Feiring&#x2019;s emotional tale of a remarkable country and people who have survived religious wars and Soviet occupation yet managed always to keep hold of their precious wine traditions. Embedded in the narrative is the hope that Georgia has the temerity to confront its latest threat&#x2014;modernization.</p><br></p><p><b>Alice Feiring</b> is an internationally known author, journalist, and essayist who lives in New York City.

Magee is the Carl Sagan of philosophy, the great popularizer of the subject, and author of a major new introductory history, The Story of Philosophy. Confessions follows the course of Magee&#39;s life, exploring philosophers and ideas as he himself encountered them, introducing all the great figures and their ideas, from the pre-Socratics to Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper, including Wittgenstein, Kant, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer, rationalism, utilitarianism, empiricism, and existentialism.</p><p><i>Confessions</i> is a somewhat misleading term in this context: you won't find any lurid tales between these covers. Bryan Magee's memoirs-cum-histories of philosophy aren't even "confessions" in the self-flagellating tradition of St. Augustine and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.<p> So what is <i>Confessions of a Philosopher</i>, then? It's a fascinating excursion through 2,000 years of wondering about the basic nature of existence and reality. As a 20th-century philosopher, Magee has a lot to say about his peers, and he spares no feelings. The "Oxford philosophers," who decided that philosophy was not about the nature of existence but about the nature of <i>language</i>, yet refused to give any consideration to fiction, are particular targets of Magee's intellectual scorn, while the late Karl Popper, a personal acquaintance of the author, is celebrated as a man who persevered in philosophy's true duties in the face of widespread academic frippery.</p><p> If you've ever wondered why we exist, you have what it takes to be a philosopher ... or at least to understand one. Bryan Magee's <i>Confessions</i> are thoroughly engaging proof that you don't need a degree to be a deep thinker.</p>&#34;A restless intellect and independent outlook characterize this candid autobiography, which will richly reward the serious reader.&#34;--Publishers Weekly, starred review</p><h2>All Children Flourishing - Igniting the Greatness of Our Children</h2><p>This approach was originally designed to help families help their difficult children better adapt to school and family life. During years of using this approach with these children, however, I discovered that it works beautifully to foster inner strength, higher achievement, happiness, security and exemplary conduct in every child. It is not just another positive approach to parenting designed to improve behavior. Rather, it s an approach to greatness, a method of recognizing and appreciating the gifts each child possesses. Parents who had been desperate to find something that worked and adopted the Nurtured Heart Approach with their difficult child typically also used the approach with their other children, because it s just easier that way. They would then report similar, extraordinary results: they described their other children as flourishing beyond anything they had ever seen or experienced before. This approach gives parents enormous power to help every child navigate an ever more complex world with confidence and an inner compass of greatness. Children need a real inheritance, not monetary wealth, but inner wealth. We may no longer have the luxury of using old methods - conventional and traditional ways of instilling self-esteem and enforcing/reinforcing positive choices considering all that a child faces these days. We need approaches that put us all in an advantageous situation: a place where parents have tools at their disposal that reliably infuse their children with enormous inner strength. We can no longer just occasionally urge our children to feel self-worth, to make better choices and to have a better attitude. A more proactive approach is needed. We have to give them irrefutable evidence, in real time, that they are successful...right here and right now!</p><p>Howard Glasser, M.A. is the founder of Children s Success Foundation and designer of the Nurtured Heart Approach. He and Jennifer Easley are the co-authors of Transforming the Difficult Child: The Nurtured Heart Approach (1999), currently the top selling book on the topic of ADHD, The Inner Wealth Initiative (2007) with Tom Grove, and the Transforming the Difficult Child Workbook (2008) with Joann Bowdidge and Lisa Bravo. He has been a featured guest on CNN and a consultant on 48 Hours. He lectures in the U.S. and internationally, teaching therapists, educators and parents about the Nurtured Heart Approach, which is now being used in hundreds of thousands of homes and classrooms around the world. Howard is former director and clinical supervisor of the Center for the Difficult Child in Tucson, Arizona. He has been a consultant for numerous psychiatric, judicial and educational programs. Although he has done extensive doctoral work in the fields of Clinical Psychology and Educational Leadership, he feels his own years as a difficult child contributed the most to his understanding of the needs of challenging children and to the success of his approach. He lives in Tucson, Arizona.Howard Glasser has created a method for delivering energy from the heart of the parent directly into the heart of the child. The key is that the heart immediately responds to truth. This separates Howard s method from others that are more procedural and rule-bound. You re working here with the energy of love with true acknowledgement of the greatness of everyone involved in this energetic transaction. --Susanna and Puran Bair, authors of Energize Your Heart<br><br>This remarkable approach has already changed the lives of many families I know.

A bird loses his favorite feather, a dog gets her leash tangled in a fence, a fox loses his mother, and a squirrel drops her nut. But then, the squirrel finds an even bigger nut, the fox is reunited with his mother, the dog frees her leash, and the bird discovers he can fly higher than ever, even without his feather. The animals' triumphant expressions and perky postures, in sharp contrast to their former dejected demeanors, bear witness to the fact that the bad day has turned out to be a good one after all. In a surprising twist, a young girl finds the bird's feather, "tuck[s] it behind her ear," and runs to her mother shouting, "What a good day!" A reprise of all four creatures in the last scene as the excited child seeks out her parent is the perfect conclusion. Full-page, pastel-hued watercolor-and-ink illustrations appear framed opposite each page of large, brief text. This gentle story affords an opportunity to introduce the very young to ways of dealing with life's small disappointments.

No other prophet rivals Isaiah's brilliance of style, powerful imagery and clear vision of the messianic hope. Isaiah's prophetic ministry begins with his temple vision and calling: "I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send?'" Through a series of oracles Isaiah calls Israel and the nations to turn to the Lord, for judgment is coming. He announces that redemption is found in the Davidic Servant alone. Finally, in the "day of vengeance and the year of redemption" the Anointed Conqueror will punish rebellious peoples, comfort the contrite and reestablish the glory of Zion. J. Alec Motyer, author of the unparalleled one-volume commentary <em>The Prophecy of Isaiah,</em> now provides the long-awaited final volume in the Tyndale Old Testament Commentary Series. Unlike many Isaiah commentators who divide the book between chapters 1-39 and 40-66, Motyer instead identifies three messianic portraits: the King (Isaiah 1-37), the Servant (Isaiah 38-55), and the Anointed Conqueror (Isaiah 56-66). This volume provides Motyer's lucid exposition on these three portraits, examining Isaiah with insightful and probing passage-by-passage commentary. All who study the text of Isaiah will find here expert scholarship and solid footing for unraveling difficult issues of exegesis and interpretation. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series.</p><p>J. Alec Motyer (1924&#x2013;2016) was a renowned Old Testament pastor and scholar. With extensive experience in parish ministry, he was principal of Trinity College in Bristol, England, and was well known as a Bible expositor. His books include <em>The Prophecy of Isaiah</em>, and he was the Old Testament editor of The Bible Speaks Today commentary series."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A. Hagner, Fuller Theological Seminary)</p><h2>Pure and Simple: The Extraordinary Teachings of a Thai Buddhist Laywoman</h2><p>Upasika Kee was a uniquely powerful spiritual teacher. Evocative of the great Ajahn Chah, her teachings are earthy, refreshingly direct, and hard-hitting. In the twentieth century, she grew to become one of the most famous teachers in Thailand--male or female--all the more remarkable because, rarer still, she was not a monastic but a layperson. Her relentless honesty, along with her encouraging voice, is one reason so many contemporary Buddhist teachers recall Upasika Kee so fondly, and so often. With this book, readers seeking something reminiscent of the classic <i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i> can receive instruction on meditation practice as they become acquainted with the legacy of a renowned Buddhist figure. <i>Pure and Simple</i>, the first widely-available collection of her writings, will be gratefully received not only by those who knew Upasika Kee, but by anyone who encounters her for the first time in its pages.</p><p>"She is described as one of the foremost lay Buddhist teachers of the twentieth century, but many Western readers will be introduced to Upasika Kee Nanayon for the first time in Pure and Simple. Born in Thailand at the turn of the century, Upasika Kee gave up the family business in mid-life to found a forest retreat center, where she devoted herself to meditation and study until her death in 1993. Thanissaro Bhikkhu, an American who studied in the Forest Tradition for twenty years in Thailand, is a translator of Pali and Thai and here he turns his adept hand to Upasika Kee. She was a Buddhist from the old school who talked the talk and walked the walk. The book's title neatly summarizes the themes that run through many of these talks: keep it pure by staying away from defilements, and keep it simple by avoiding distractions. That's keeping it real, Upasika Kee-style." Source: Shambhala Sun<br><br>"Upasika Kee teaches from her own experience in a voice that is clear and unwavering. Her devotion to liberation is apparent everywhere on these pages." Author: Sharon Salzberg, author of Lovingkindness and Faith<br><br>"Wonderful news! These extraordinary teachings are now available for a wide readership. Upasika Kee presents Buddhadharma in a simple, direct and unadorned way. Profound insights and approaches to practice are delivered with a freshness that seems to be coming right out of her own meditations--right then and there."

Source: Body and Soul<br><br>"Upasika Kee broke through to complete inner peace. Here is one woman's universal achievement." Author: Kate Wheeler, editor of Nixon Under the Bodhi Tree and Other Works of Buddhist Fiction<br><br>"Upasika Kee is a true 'dharma warrior.' Her teaching is always uncompromising and tough-as-nails. She always speaks the truth no matter what." Author: Mu Soeng, author of Trust in Mind and The Diamond SutraUpasika Kee (1901-78) was an extremely popular Buddhist teacher in Thailand, starting a retreat center in the hills outside Rajburi that still thrives today. In this rare collection of her writings, Upasika Kee displays relentless honesty in conveying her experience of, and devotion to, Dhamma practice. She says one must be uncompromising in one's dedication to upholding Buddhist precepts. To detach from ego-based thought, to persistently practice meditation and breath work, to tame the "monkey mind," these are the basics, and, in her opinion, the only road to awareness. According to Upasika Kee, without serious practice, one will never stop the suffering caused by the mental "defilements" that drive us. Readers just learning about Buddhism will find the book thought-provoking, but the real audience will be those already dedicated to Buddhist practice. Interestingly, Upasika Kee was self-taught, learning most of her practice from reading. It seems apropos for this book to be the means for other Buddhist devotees to follow suit. <i>Janet St. John</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

How do we sustain momentum?" They know that companies and organizations cannot thrive today without learning to adapt their attitudes and practices. But companies that establish change initiatives discover, after initial success, that even the most promising efforts to transform or revitalize organizations&#x2014;despite interest, resources, and compelling business results&#x2014;can fail to sustain themselves over time. That's because organizations have complex, well-developed immune systems, aimed at preserving the status quo.<br><br>Now, drawing upon new theories about leadership and the long-term success of change initiatives, and based upon twenty-five years <br>of experience building learning organizations, the authors of <b>The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook</b> show how to accelerate success and avoid the obstacles that can stall momentum. <b>The Dance of Change</b>, written for managers and executives at every level of an organization, reveals how business leaders can work together to anticipate the challenges that profound change will ultimately force the organization to face. Then, in a down-to-earth and compellingly clear format, readers will learn how to build the personal and organizational capabilities needed to meet those challenges.<br><br>These challenges are not imposed from the outside; they are the product of assumptions and practices that people take for granted&#x2014;an inherent, natural part of the processes of change. And they can stop innovation cold, unless managers at all levels learn to anticipate them and recognize the hidden rewards in each challenge, and the potential to spur further growth. Within the frequently encountered challenge of "Not Enough Time," for example&#x2014;the lack of control over time available for innovation and learning initiatives&#x2014;lies a valuable opportunity to reframe the way people organize their workplaces.<br><br>This book identifies universal challenges that organizations ultimately find themselves confronting, including the challenge of "Fear and Anxiety"; the need to diffuse learning across organizational boundaries; the ways in which assumptions built in to corporate measurement systems can handcuff learning initiatives; and the almost unavoidable misunderstandings between "true believers" and nonbelievers in a company.<br><br>Filled with individual and team exercises, in-depth accounts of sustaining learning initiatives by managers and leaders in the field, and well-tested practical advice, <b>The Dance of Change</b> provides an insider's perspective on implementing learning and change initiatives at such corporations as British Petroleum, Chrysler, Dupont, Ford, General Electric, Harley-Davidson, Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi Electric, Royal DutchShell, Shell Oil Company, Toyota, the United States Army, and Xerox. It offers crucial advice for line-level managers, executive leaders, internal networkers, educators, and others who are struggling to put change initiatives into practice.</p><p>Since its release in 1990, Peter M. Senge's bestselling <i>The Fifth Discipline</i> has converted readers to its innovative business principles of the "learning organization," personal mastery, and systems thinking. Published nearly a decade later, <i>Dance of Change</i> provides a formidable response to businesspeople wondering how to make his programs stick. He outlines potential obstacles (such as initiating transformation, personal fear and anxiety, and measuring the unmeasurable) and proposes ways to turn these obstacles into sources of improvement. Senge--with considerable help from the team who worked on the follow-up development manual, <i>The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook</i>--presents an insider's account of long-term maintenance efforts at General Electric, Harley-Davidson, the U.S. Army, and others who are learning organization, along with experience-based suggestions and exercises for individuals and teams. "We are seeking to understand how people nurture the reinforcing growth processes that naturally enable an organization to evolve and change," Senge explains, "and how they tend to the limiting processes that can impede or stop that growth." <i>--Howard Rothman</i>Advance Acclaim for <i>The Dance of Change</i>:<p>"Do not read this book from cover to cover.

A language, however, is as dynamic as the people who use it, and the expressions that give live and relevance to an idea in one era tend to lose currency in the next. To continue relying on the century-old, first English edition by Anna Blackwell, would be a grave injustice--to modern readers of the work, to Kardec&#39;s impeccable reasoning, and to the guide&#39;s illuminating insights.</p><h2>Tiny Goes to the Movies</h2><p><b>It's movie night in the park!</b><br><br>Tiny and Eliot love summer.

Her writing has been published in anthologies, magazines, and journals. She holds an M.A. in Literature and has worked in education in South Florida.Thirteen Ways of Looking at a French Woman<br><br> J. Courtney Sullivan<br><br> I. 1987<br><br> It begins, like all things, with my mother.<br><br> In our suburban Massachusetts neighborhood, full of Irish Catholics who throw block parties and summer cookouts, she believes that, in her heart, she is French. She collects Quimper pottery, wears silk scarves with the confidence of a native Parisian, and spritzes Chanel N5 on the dog after a bath.<br><br> Her passion is inherited from her own mother, my grandmother, who to me seems every bit as glamorous as Catherine Deneuve. She subscribes to W, and when she's collected enough back issues, she bags them up and brings them over to our house. My grandmother is known for being the first person ever to jog in her neighborhood, long before there was such a thing as jogging attire-she did it in a trench coat. She goes into the city to get her hair done at a proper salon that costs a fortune instead of at some underwhelming beauty parlor closer to home. She, too, believes that French women are superior to us, not that she knows any French women. Her portals to that world are fashion magazines and Julia Child, whom she watches religiously on television, absorbing Child's thoughts on butter and wine, filling notebooks with her recipes. Notebooks we will find and cherish after my grandmother is gone.<br><br> II. 1996<br><br> In high school French class, we watch the movies Red, White, and Blue, Kielowski's Three Colors trilogy. On my own, I watch Before Sunrise approximately ninety-seven times. I want to be Juliette Binoche and Julie Delpy in equal measure, even though they are nothing alike. They are both French. Seemingly effortless in their beauty. Strong and commanding and flawlessly dressed, even at life's most depressing moments. I have that sense that if I just study them enough, I might become them through osmosis. I am fifteen. Nothing my mother does could possibly please me. But I realize that on this one point, she was correct: French women are spectacular in every way.<br><br> I love the language. I love my French teacher, who tells us one day, "Joy is happiness with no strings attached." Later, when almost all my French is forgotten, I will remember this.<br><br> III. 2001<br><br> I announce that I plan to take a year off from college, horrifying my mother. I want to write and see the world. I would love to spend the year in France, but I don't have the guts, or the confidence for the language. I am twenty and I have never been outside the United States. As if to put a fine point on my naivet , I declare that I will either move to London, or to Orlando, Florida, where I'll be employed at Disney World as part of a student work program. The program offers all kinds of positions. Some people even get to dress up as characters, perform in shows. I apply and am granted the job of fry cook. And so I choose London, where I work first as an intern at a literary agency, and later as a nanny for a family with three boys under the age of two.<br><br> I tell my friend Kirsty at the agency about my love of Paris, my urge to go. She says she knows Americans are crazy about it, but the place doesn't hold such allure for the English. Paris is for quick weekend jaunts, bachelorette parties, that sort of thing.<br><br> One long weekend, I finally go, and stay with a friend who is studying abroad there. We last saw each other at our casual college in the middle of nowhere, a place where pajama pants were considered appropriate dinner attire. But now I find that the city and all its glamor have made an impact on her. She is living as a lodger in the home of a Parisian book editor in the 16th arrondissement. She skips lunch each day and saves up to buy a Louis Vuitton clutch instead. (Though she confesses that once, in a fit of homesickness, she devoured a Big Mac. When she tells the story, she does not call McDonald's "McDonald's." She calls it, in perfectly accented French, McDo. Somehow even fast food seems more glamorous here.)<br><br> This is it. At last. The Paris the women of my family have been dreaming about forever. I am the first of us to reach it. I get my picture taken in front of the Eiffel Tower but to my surprise I can't manage to feel much for it. I have seen too many pictures, maybe, imagined it too many times. I had a stronger reaction to Brussels a month before, perhaps because I never had a single expectation for Brussels.<br><br> My friend and I rush through the Louvre and P re Lachaise like commuters at Penn Station. She is a generous host, but she has seen all this already. What she really wants to do is what everyone our age in every city wants to do-go out, get drunk, meet boys. Who am I to argue?<br><br> I watch French women on the train, in the shops, sitting outside at sidewalk caf s. It is true, what I've always believed about their beauty, their style. It's a code I want to crack, though I don't actually converse with a single French person, except for a passing hello to the book editor, and a boy I kiss at a bar, also more or less in passing.<br><br> The next morning, as I board the Eurostar back to London, a text message appears: I kiss you, I love you, I remember you all my life.<br><br> It is ridiculous, over-the-top. A cartoon of what a Frenchman might say. I keep it like a souvenir until the phone is lost.<br><br> IV. 2004<br><br> After graduation, I move to New York to become a writer. My first job is as an assistant at a beauty magazine, where I am a total fish out of water. But I find that everyone in this world worships French women as much as I do. I interview photographers and stylists. Their inspirations for looks are always French women from several decades ago. Brigitte Bardot, Anouk Aim e.<br><br> Between student loan debt and the rent on a shared shoe-box apartment, I am well aware that I'm too poor to even think about visiting Paris again any time soon. I go there in books. Books I really like, like Adam Gopnik's Paris to the Moon. Books I love, like Diane Johnson's Le Divorce. Silly books about beauty secrets that I take from the communal shelf at work after everyone else has gone home. Chief among them: French Women Don't Get Fat.<br><br> I don't read this as a guide, hoping to become the things I find in its pages. I read it like I am Margaret Mead watching the Samoans, or an alien just landing on planet Earth and taking a look around. I have nothing in common with the women described in the book, much as I admire them. I wear Nikes to the office. Not even ballet flats. I am an impossibly bad dresser. Though I spend my days writing about makeup, I don't really know how to apply it. I have, in fact, gotten a little bit fat.<br><br> V. 2007<br><br> I get a job at the New York Times, doing research for an opinion columnist. I start writing for the paper, too. On the weekends, I work on my novel. The tools I use during the week seep into my fiction. I like to create a character not from nothing, but by building the emotions and the unknowable on top of what can be known. I want to get the details just right. So when I write a worm farmer, I interview worm farmers. Dollhouse aficionados and paramedics get the same treatment.<br><br> It is a total thrill, getting to peer into other people's worlds. The best part of the job.<br><br> VI. 2010<br><br> My first novel, Commencement, is published. One day I get an e-mail from an editor in Paris named Marie. She wants to know if her small publishing house can have the French rights to the book.<br><br> There are agents to consult at moments like this. Negotiations to be made. But picture it: My book in French. I reply right away. Yes, of course Marie can have the rights.<br><br> VII. 2010<br><br> Nearly a decade after my first trip to Paris, I get to go back. My boyfriend Kevin and I are house-sitting for friends in London, and we make a quick three-night detour to the City of Light. This time, I am determined to do it right. To see everything important, all the sights.<br><br> A year earlier, my mother finally got her chance to go. I ask her for travel tips and we copy her itinerary more or less to the letter. She warns us not to try to do everything. Enjoy it, move at a leisurely pace. But instead, we try to do everything. As with that first glimpse of the Eiffel Tower years earlier, we find that there is far less joy in the expected attractions than there is in the surprises-our hotel in the Latin Quarter, built on the remains of a thirteenth-century abbey; a party we stumble upon in the grand courtyard of an art school, the students dancing and singing and showcasing their work. But some of the expected places are incredible too. Versailles astonishes me. I could stay at the piano bar at the H&#x2122;tel de Crillon for weeks. I think of how beauty is such an important part of everyday life in Paris in a way it is not in New York, as we sit in the Luxembourg Gardens and watch children eating ice cream carved into the shape of flowers.<br><br> We are, decidedly, tourists. As evidenced by the thick blue-and-yellow copy of Rick Steves Paris that we carry everywhere we go. A few times a day, I glimpse someone else carrying this book, and we smile bashfully at each other, found out.<br><br> The taxi drivers can't understand my attempts at French. They switch to English seconds after I open my mouth. I am kind of relieved getting back to London, a city that has never seemed intimidating to me.<br><br> VIII. 2012<br><br> Commencement is released in France and becomes a bestseller there. In French, it is called Les Debutantes.<br><br> I am beginning a new novel, my third, called The Engagements. From the start, I know that one of the main characters will be a glamorous Parisian woman. A woman I will never be, but have always admired from afar.<br><br> I begin by interviewing Parisian transplants to Boston and New York. I ask them everything. One of the things I cherish most about being a writer is this: If you were just to say to a person, "Tell me everything about yourself," they might balk. But if you say, "I am a writer, tell me so that I can make a story from it," they will almost always do it.<br><br> The women I talk to make excellent subjects because they've lived in both worlds. I decide my character will be the same. A Parisian transplant to New York, so that I can see what my own city looks like through her eyes. I give her a name. Delphine.<br><br> My interview subjects mention the small irritations of American life-too much air-conditioning, the ubiquity of Starbucks. And big ones, too-how strangers cling to false familiarity, making promises to get together again, but never keeping them. Helicopter parents. The gym-obsessed. The way, at dinner parties, people tend to pair off and talk to only one person instead of having a lively group discussion.<br><br> The things they miss most include good bread, Avene Hydrance Optimale face cream. French Elle. Paris Match.<br><br> I learn that in their kitchens in Paris, there are always cubes instead of grains in the sugar bowl. That pastis is never kept in the fridge. That as a term of endearment, one's mother might call one mon tourterelle, "my turtledove." They tell me that in Paris, if you meet someone for coffee but don't feel like the caffeine, you might order a citron press -lemonade. They tell me of a French wedding tradition in which a bride and groom hide in a broom closet, waiting to be found by their guests.<br><br> I want to know Delphine's Paris. It seems only responsible to return there for research. Kevin comes with me again. We are recently engaged. I know exactly where I want to go-Montmartre and the rue Cler, the two neighborhoods I have decided will be most important to Delphine.<br><br> Through a company called Paris Walks, I hire a private guide, Brad, who takes us around Montmartre, where he lives. I have been before, but now I notice new things. A luthier's shop with violins hanging in the window. A small vineyard that was tended by Benedictine monks in the twelfth century. The old tabacs turned late-night grocery stores run by North African immigrants. The astonishing view of Paris from the outdoor tables at Chez Pommette. The artist studios built high up in the garrets of old houses, where the light is best. An ivy-covered brick house on rue Cauchois, with tall white shutters and bright red geraniums in the window boxes.<br><br> Before, in Paris, I was always self-conscious. Did I sound like a stupid American? Was my accent atrocious? But in the role of writer, I'm too curious to care.<br><br> Kevin and I go to hear a violin soloist play in the &#x192;glise de Saint-Germain-des-Pr s. We stumble upon a summer carnival at the edge of the Tuileries Gardens late one night-at picnic tables, people eat cr pes and cotton candy, and drink wine. Children jump on trampolines and scream with mock terror on the rides.<br><br> On a Sunday morning, we go to a bustling outdoor market beneath the elevated train tracks on the boulevard de Grenelle. Fruit merchants sell enormous tomatoes and eggplant, ripe cherries, artichokes, seven different kinds of mushrooms. One stall has thirty kinds of olives in wooden bins, and any herb or nut you could imagine. There are men selling fish and meat, all of it displayed beautifully, presentation as important as quality. At a fromagerie, a father-daughter pair offers two dozen wheels of cheese, which they slice and wrap in pale blue paper. Flower stalls burst with roses and calla lilies. I eat three tiny beignets while I watch old ladies do their shopping for the week.<br><br> This is the trip on which I fall in love with Paris. Not Paris as I'd imagined it, but Paris as it is.<br><br> IX. 2012<br><br> I write all of Delphine's chapters in a small guest bedroom at Kevin's mother's house in Des Moines, Iowa. It's about as un-Parisian a setting as you can get, but the memories are fresh and I can transport myself there in an instant.</p><h2>Word and Power Church, The</h2><p>A careful look at Scripture, church history, and the church today revealing the need for both the Pentecostal and evangelical perspectives.Evangelicals and charismatics have long been at odds. One side champions the Word, the other the Holy Spirit. But are the Word and Spirit really in conflict or does God&#x2019;s ideal include both sound biblical teaching and God&#x2019;s inner leading? Pastor Doug Banister shows that it&#x2019;s time to get rid of either-or thinking and discover the incredible potential that arises when evangelicals combine their strengths with charismatics. This thought-provoking book looks at the why-tos and how-tos of worshiping God in spirit and in truth.</p><p>There is a new generation of Christians who are tired of either-or; they are hungry for the Word and thirsty for the Spirit, writes Doug Banister. Today the two rivers are merging into one mighty flood of spiritual power. With these words, Banister describes the crumbling of walls between charismatics and evangelicals. As a solidly evangelical seminary graduate and pastor, Banister admits to having disdained charismatics. That is, until meticulous study of God&#39;s Word convinced him that miraculous gifts of tongues, healing, and prophecy are indeed valid for today. As he details his journey beyond categories, Banister explores the reasons for the age-old rift between the two camps and the ways in which healing is taking place in new Word and Power churches all over America. When evangelicals and charismatics bring together the best from each tradition, he has discovered that the result is a strong, unified body.Word and Power churches . . . affirm the authority of Scripture and encourage the prophetic embrace those who pray in a spiritual language and honor those who don&#39;t stir emotion for Jesus and pursue obedience to him edify the believer and evangelize the seeker heal the sick and comfort the suffering The Word and Power Church will speak to Christians everywhere who want to walk in both the integrity of Scripture and the power of the Holy Spirit.Dr. Doug Banister is the pastor of Fellowship Church, an Evangelical Free Church planted in Knoxville, TN. He has the M.Dive from Talbot School of Theology and a D.Min. from Gordon-Conwell. His undergraduate degree was in journalism at Northwestern University</p><h2>The Ill-Made Knight (Chivalry)</h2><p><p><b>An action-packed tale of chivalry and betrayal set during the Hundred Years War.</b></p><p>September, 1356.

She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts."Nourishment consultant" Schatz convincingly urges readers to eschew refined and processed foods and replace them with organic fruits, vegetables and lean proteins. Her "transformational nourishment" incorporates Japanese and Chinese medicine with philosophy, naturopathic nutrition and herbal medicine. The book's first section sets the mood, counseling readers on "coming home to your spirit" and explaining the semantic difference between "Eating" and "Feeding," leading into the more practical and enticing sections. Part two, "Nourishment as Daily Practice," explains the benefits of "vital essence foods": foods that are as close to the source as possible. Schatz advises readers to eat seasonal produce, since not adhering to nature's rhythms can throw a body out of balance. She describes in detail how to flush toxins out of the body by eating the right foods rather than fasting. Part three, "Awakening Your Spirit," lays out predictable advice on being conscious of what foods one introduces into the body and making eating a pleasant ritual. The final section presents healthy, simple, Asian-influenced recipes. Throughout the book, Schatz shares accounts from clients who changed their lives drastically just by changing their diets. There is an important, useful message at this book's core, and Schatz does offer a unique approach to nutrition.

Once you receive a diabetes diagnosis, your only option is to manage the symptoms with a restricted diet, close monitoring of blood sugar, and expensive medications. Dr. Colbert shows that diabetes can be treated instead through safe, natural means, like healthy food and vitamins rather than strictly relying on prescription drugs. He shows you how to manage your weight and your glucose intake with a whole-body approach, using nutritional supplements along with dietary and lifestyle changes to lose weight, repair cell damage, improve insulin function, and reduce the side effects from prescription drugs, many of which rob nutrients from the body and cause additional symptoms.<br> &nbsp; Based on the same life-changing principles of the low-glycemic, high-fiber eating plan provided in Dr. Colbert&#x2019;s <i>New York Times </i>best-selling book, <i>Dr. Colbert&#x2019;s &#x201c;I Can Do This&#x201d; Diet</i>, this book adapts that plan in a way that makes it ideal for diabetics who need to manage their glucose levels and their weight. &nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;Siloam, an imprint of Charisma House Book Group, is the leader in the Christian health and fitness genre, with several best-sellers...including Don Colbert's The Bible Cure series.&#x201d; --<b><i>Christian Retailing</i></b> <b>&nbsp;</b> &#x201c;Physician Don Colbert Preaches The Gospel Of Good Nutrition, Advising His Patients To Follow In The Footsteps Of One Of History's Better-known Role Models.&#x201d; --<i>Orlando Sentinel</i> <br></p><p><p><b>Don Colbert, MD</b>, is board certified in family practice and in anti-aging medicine.

He shows how all types of diabetics can improve their blood panels and reduce their dependence on medication when they discover the food choices, nutritional supplements, and exercise types that work best to regulate blood sugar. Though the large amount of technical information offered could be overwhelming, the youthful sparkle in Kelly Dolan&#x2019;s excellent performance keeps listeners&#x2019; attention from start to finish. He has appealing phrasing along with a quiet urgency in his voice that ebbs and flows in exactly the right amounts and all the right places.

This is an excellent resource book.</p><p>Historically, the book of Exodus treats of the deliverance of Israel from Egypt; but viewed doctrinally, it deals with redemption.

The universe is established with God&#x2019;s light shining through everything. There is a profound understanding of this in the way in which a day is described in Genesis and subsequently in all Jewish life. &#x201c;And there was evening and there was morning, one day&#x201d; (verse 5, RSV). An odd way to describe a day, but not if you see it as a victory of God&#x2019;s light. Evening has the sense, in Hebrew, of termination, bringing to a conclusion. A day is described first as the conclusion of the creative work of God, then night, a time of sleep, the incursion of darkness, a threat to the order of creation, a sign of chaos to come. Does night or light have the last word? The answer is in the phrase &#x201c;and there was morning, one day.&#x201d;</p><p>Morning in Hebrew has the meaning of &#x201c;penetration.&#x201d; [1] God&#x2019;s day is not complete until light shines again, penetrating the darkness and dispersing the shadows. The creative action of God is light, which encloses and limits a temporary darkness. All that we see as a threat to God&#x2019;s creative action is held in check and controlled by his light. The shadows are there&#x2014;night descends upon life&#x2014;and there is that which seems to defy God, to disturb his order and his purpose: sickness, death, trouble, and sorrow. But it does not have the last word: &#x201c;And there was morning, one day.&#x201d;</p><p>***</p><p>Identify an area of your life in which you need God&#x2019;s light to penetrate the dimness.

Neuroscience now provides a new way forward. Highlighting several key aspects of neuroscience that are vital to inclusion, this book provides new, brain-based strategies and tools for working across differences in ways that build trust, foster creativity, and result in higher level outcomes. This book offers a new understanding and approach to recognizing and overriding unconscious biases, and provides additional brain skills that support us in overriding other unconscious brain dynamics that can interfere with even our best intentions to be inclusive. This book also offers new hope in building positive, authentic connections across differences. Using appreciation-based tools such as the Care-Frame&#x2122; and the S.A.V.E. Communication&#x2122; Model, it is now possible to work with others who are very different from ourselves in ways that deepen our understanding and appreciation of each other's different life experiences, backgrounds, beliefs and perspectives. In this new brain-based approach, we can more effectively and consistently demonstrate inclusive behaviors across differences - even if those differences cause an initial feeling of discomfort. Incorporating these new brain-based inclusion skills and tools offers new opportunities to more consciously and consistently work across differences effectively. These new brain skills will shape the inclusive workplaces of tomorrow.</p><p></p><h2>An American Odyssey: The Life and Work of Romare Bearden</h2><p>By the time of his death in 1988, Romare Bearden was most widely celebrated for his large-scale public murals and collages, which were reproduced in such places as Time and Esquire to symbolize and evoke the black experience in America. As Mary Schmidt Campbell shows us in this definitive, defining, and immersive biography, the relationship between art and race was central to his life and work -- a constant, driving creative tension. Bearden started as a cartoonist during his college years, but in the later 1930s turned to painting and became part of a community of artists supported by the WPA. As his reputation grew he perfected his skills, studying the European masters and analyzing and breaking down their techniques, finding new ways of applying them to the America he knew, one in which the struggle for civil rights became all-absorbing. By the time of the March on Washington in 1963, he had begun to experiment with the Projections, as he called his major collages, in which he tried to capture the full spectrum of the black experience, from the grind of daily life to broader visions and aspirations. <br><br>Campbell's book offers a full and vibrant account of Bearden's life -- his years in Harlem (his studio was above the Apollo theater), to his travels and commissions, along with illuminating analysis of his work and artistic career. Campbell, who met Bearden in the 1970s, was among the first to compile a catalogue of his works. <em>An American Odyssey</em> goes far beyond that, offering a living portrait of an artist and the impact he made upon the world he sought both to recreate and celebrate.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mary Schmidt Campbell</strong> is President of Spelman College and Dean Emerita of the Tisch School of the Arts. She served as the vice chair of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities under former President Barack Obama.<br><br>"<em>An American Odyssey: The Life and Work of Romare Bearden</em> is a fascinating book, lovingly detailed and closely illustrating how its subject had to struggle, both as an artist and as a black person, to establish a place in the history of art in America." -- Jim Burns, <em>The Penniless Press</em><p></p><br>"Campbell offers a discerning portrait of Bearden's long and successful career... A perceptive, richly detailed biography."--<em>Kirkus</em> <br><p></p><br>"A dynamic portrait... Bearden once wrote, 'The Negro artist must come to think of himself not primarily as a Negro artist, but as an artist,' and Campbell perfectly encapsulates that notion in this analysis of Bearden's remarkable career."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> <br><p></p><br>"[Campbell] authoritatively conveys the complexity of Bearden's struggles as a Black artist who both aggressively supported his Black colleagues in Harlem-based exhibitions and believed that the universality of artistic vision must move beyond any single community to be most effective. It is an exhilarating and instructive read." --Ruth Fine, Curator <br><p></p><br>"Meticulously researched and highly readable, this ground-breaking analytical biography of one of the twentieth century's leading figures in painting, collage and other art forms is an immensely important addition to recent art historical literature and biography. It is a pleasure to read and is a necessary addition to our American cultural consciousness." --Edward J. Sullivan, Helen Gould Sheppard Professor of the History of Art, Institute of Fine Arts (Deputy Director), New York University<p></p><br>"In this extraordinary book, Mary Schmidt Campbell unveils-in brilliantly researched and captivating language-the journey of unrelenting effort and self-discovery that has earned Romare Bearden a place of rare distinction, as both an artist universally revered by the greater art world and as a 'hero' to his own people.... Every page is abundant with vivid imagery and detail that brings Romare Bearden's artistic odyssey to life. Bravo!" --Dianne McIntyre, Choreographer <br><p></p><br>"Dr. Campbell's elegant prose and impeccable scholarship brilliantly illuminate the life and career of one of the twentieth century's great artistic visionaries. True to its name, <em>An American Odyssey</em> positions Romare Bearden's journey as both deeply his own and inexorably tied to our nation's history." --Thelma Golden, Director and Chief Curator, The Studio Museum in Harlem <br><p></p><br>"Through her long association with Romare Bearden and his work, Mary Schmidt Campbell possesses a rare understanding of his life and artistry. In this beautifully written volume, she sensitively illuminates his biography and comprehensively traces the trajectory of his career. By brilliantly interweaving the political history of African Americans throughout the 20th century with the emergence of one our foremost artists, she has written a book that speaks to anyone who is interested in American history, art, and culture. Campbell writes that Bearden's legacy is his ability to create worlds; in this biography, she re-creates Bearden's world." --Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Harvard University <br><p></p><br>"By navigating the historical, social, and political contexts informing black aesthetics and Bearden's unique oeuvre, Campbell, president of Spelman College, has produced an invaluable work."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"Ms. Campbell's book will be of interest to those just discovering Bearden as well as to experts, along with anyone interested in the history of American art in the mid-to-late 20th century. It is an admirable gesture of friendship from author to subject, one which, in its most closely observed pages, does justice to a remarkable life."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"Campbell's extraordinarily rich biography offers its readers many rewards. Nowhere here is the awkwardness of critics unfamiliar with the history of black art or who isolate it from its frames of reference or consider only how black artists ought to criticize race in America. Hers is a self-confident study of an artist's life in all its contexts."--<em>The Nation</em>, Nell Painter<p></p><br></p><h2>Ovid: Amores Metamorphoses (English and Latin Edition)</h2><p>This bestseller now features 277 more lines of Ovid!

It responds to these questions: "What if God didn't place humans on earth to be <em>stewards </em>of creation, but something else?" and "if not stewards, then what?"</p><p>The chapters in <em>Beyond Stewardship </em>are written by scholars from diverse disciplines who share a deep passion for a flourishing creation. Each chapter begins with a compelling story that draws the reader into new ways of thinking. Each author then looks beyond stewardship from the context of her or his own discipline and experiences. Some reimagine creation care by expanding on the traditional notion of stewardship. Others set aside the stewardship model and offer alternative ways to understand our presence within the broader creation. The chapters mark out ways to live better in the places we inhabit as individuals, communities, and institutions.</p><p>Collectively, the essays in <em>Beyond Stewardship</em> offer an expanded and enlivened understanding of the place of humans in the context of God's creation.</p></p><p><p> For several decades now, <em>stewardship </em>has been the dominant concept guiding progressive Christian ecological thought and practice. The authors identify various ways in which they and others have come to regard this concept as inadequate and distorting. Then, with vivid stories, up-to-date science, perceptive biblical interpretation, and theological imagination, they propose new ways of thinking. We are <em>earthlings </em>responsible for <em>earthkeeping. </em>It's a wonderful contribution: fascinating, instructive, inspiring. </p><p>-Nicholas Wolterstorff, <em>Noah Porter professor of philosophical theology emeritus, Yale University; senior fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, University of Virginia</em></p><p>Ecological theologians have long had an ambiguous relationship with the notion of stewardship. Some have critiqued it for its managerial overtones, while others have embraced it for its biblical resonance. <em>Beyond Stewardship </em>does both and neither. What emerges is a rich account of why Christians should view Earth care as integral to the spiritual life, including the types of narratives and actions that are necessary for initiating positive environmental change. Clearly written and inspiring, it should be required reading for Sunday school and college students alike.</p><p>-Gretel Van Wieren, <em>Department of Religious Studies, Michigan State University</em></p><p>This book is paradigm-shifting and conversation-changing. What would it mean to think about environmental concerns in terms of <em>reconciliation </em>rather than merely stewardship or responsibility? Whether you're just beginning to think about environmental discipleship or you've been passionate about creational justice for a long time, this book is a provocative primer.</p><p>-James K. A. Smith, <em>Gary and Henrietta Byker Chair in Applied Reformed Theology and Worldview, Calvin College</em></p><p>Inspiring ... challenging ... encouraging ... <em>Beyond Stewardship: New Approaches to Creation Care </em>will alter paradigms, burst worn-out environmental stewardship models, and shine light on a new way of living in kinship with all God's creation. </p><p>-George Heartwell, <em>former mayor of Grand Rapids, MI</em></p><p>When I started reading this collection of essays I frankly wondered if I might be bored by a series of ho-hum proposals of alternatives to the old idea of <em>stewardship</em>. But the alternative images are interwoven with an exploration of how humans interact with microbes, rusty nails, ecosystems, and the names of trees, as well as with the impact of environmental degradation on racial minorities. The result is an inspiring book that can teach us new ways to think about--and live more fruitfully in--God's good and groaning creation.</p><p>-J. Richard Middleton, <em>Professor of Biblical Worldview and Exegesis at Northeastern Seminary</em></p><p>Through the process of acknowledging our sinful actions against our Creator through abuse of His creation, our personal responsibility for the harm we have done, and our needed repentance to make things right, the contributors to <em>Beyond Stewardship </em>provide the first steps toward a more mature and biblically grounded approach to both environmental ethics and creation care. </p><p>-Fred VanDyke, <em>executive director of Au Sable Institute of Environmental Studies</em></p><p>These wonderful essays reveal and instruct, but so much more. They delight, refresh, and inspire Christians to greater love of God and of God's good creation. It's a joy to read the book, and spiritually enlarging. I wish I read it twenty years ago before writing the creation chapter of <em>Engaging God's World</em>.</p><p>-Cornelius Plantinga, Jr., <em>Senior Research Fellow at the Calvin Institute of Christian Worship</em></p></p><h2>Ride &#39;Em Cowgirl!

As their once-casual friendship quickens, these two eccentric men begin to discover in each other a possible antidote to their feelings of hopelessness and mortality&#x2014;a spiritual symmetry forged by their shared passion for music, strange sense of humor, disgust for bourgeois Vienna, and great fear in the face of death. Part memoir, part fiction, <i>Wittgenstein&#x2019;s Nephew</i> is both a meditation on the artist&#x2019;s struggle to maintain a solid foothold in a world gone incomprehensibly askew, and a stunning&#x2014;if not haunting&#x2014;eulogy to a real-life friendship.</p><p>It is 1967, in a Viennese hospital. In separate wards, two men lie bedridden: the narrator, named Thomas Bernhard, is stricken with a lung ailment; his friend Paul, nephew of the celebrated philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, is suffering from one of his periodic bouts of madness. Beginning with his memory of the hospital, Bernhard traces the growth of an intense friendship between two eccentric, obsessive men who share a passion for music, a strange sense of humor, brutal honestly, and a disgust for bourgeois Vienna.<b>Thomas Bernhard</b> was born in Holland in 1931 and grew up in Austria.

On the first anniversary of Merrin's murder, Ig spends the night drunk and doing awful things. When he wakes the next morning he has a thunderous hangover . . . and horns growing from his temples. Ig possesses a terrible new power to go with his terrible new look&#x2014;a macabre gift he intends to use to find the monster who killed his one true love.

Ignatius William Perrish wakes up bleary and confused after a night of drinking and "doing terrible things" to find he has grown horns. In addition to being horribly unsightly, these inflamed protuberances give Ig an equally ugly power--if he thinks hard enough, he can make people admit things (intimate, embarrassing, I-can't-believe-you-just-said-that details). This bizarre affliction is of particular use to Ig, who is still grieving over the murder of his childhood sweetheart (a grisly act the entire town, including his family, believes he committed). <i>Horns</i> is a wickedly fun read, and reveals Hill's uncanny knack for creating alluring characters and a riveting plot. Ig's attempts to track down the killer result in hilariously inappropriate admissions from the community, heartbreaking confessions from his own family, and of course, one hell of a showdown. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><p>Ignatius Perrish spent the night drunk and doing terrible things. He woke up the next morning with a pair of horns growing from his temples.</p> <p>At first, Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who had been raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.</p> <p>Once, the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed. But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. Nothing Ig can do or say matters. Everyone it seems, including God, has abandoned him. Everyone that is, but the devil inside. . . .</p> <p>Now Ig is possessed of a terrible new power&#x2014;a macabre talent he intends to use to find the monster who killed Merrin and destroyed his life.

This is California as only a native son, deep in the dust, could draw it.<br><br>Compelling, lyrical, and ominous, his new collection finds a different drama rising out of each confounding landscape. "The Summer of the Death of Hilario Guzman" has been praised as a "stunningly intimate" portrait of one immigrant family from Oaxaca, through harrowing border crossings and brutal raisin harvests. Down the road in the "Home Front," right-wing Christians and Jews form a strange pact that tries to silence debate on the War on Terror, and a conflicted father loses not one but two sons in Iraq. "The Last Okie in Lamont," the inspiration for the town in the <i>Grapes of Wrath</i>, has but one Okie left, who tells Arax his life story as he drives to a funeral to bury one more Dust Bowl migrant.

A former staffer at the Los Angeles Times, his work has appeared in the New York Times and The California Sunday Magazine. His books include <i>The Dreamt Land</i>, <i>In My Father's Name</i>, <i>West of the West</i>, and the bestselling The King of California, which won a California Book Award, the William Saroyan Prize from Stanford University and was named a top book of 2004 by the L.A. Times. He lives in Fresno.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Gregory Rodriguez Mark Arax is a great reporter. He has an ear for a good story. He knows where the action is, and the remarkable level of detail he captures tells us he's as tenacious and unrelenting as the most hard-boiled noir detective. He's also clearly an obsessive character, particularly enthralled by dashed dreams and hopeless causes, and in "West of the West" -- 10 loosely knit essays and an epilogue -- it's sometimes not clear where his story ends and California's begins. You'd figure that a writer trying to bag California would grab for the big guns and shoot directly at the Golden State's most glaring issues and overarching themes. But Arax has done exactly the opposite. He has decided to capture minor characters, moments and conflicts and dig deep within them, evidently hoping that the minutiae of any given tale will tell us something significant about the twisted soul of this giant state. What Arax's essays ultimately do is take us on a series of extended field trips. There's the idealistic organic dairy farmer whose milk may have poisoned children, the cancer-stricken immigrant Armenian restaurant owner who murdered his sister and mother, the retired FBI agent who thinks the government is railroading a Pakistani American terror suspect, a kid named Redwood who lived for months high up in an oak grove on the Berkeley campus so the university couldn't cut the trees down. Arax successfully evades the usual tropes about California being the land of either dreams or nightmares. Instead, his essays paint an impressionistic landscape of a land of frustration. In the first paragraph of the first chapter, Arax mentions that he's recently divorced. A few pages later, he writes that after leaving his job at the Los Angeles Times, he found himself sifting through old notebooks and finding old friends. As I read his essays, I sometimes imagined the writer wading through these notebooks late at night, perhaps with a beer in hand, trying to stitch together a coherent narrative of a life that had gone off course. In the epilogue, we learn about the tragedy that makes Arax tick, the horrible event that honed his investigative skills as a journalist. When Mark was 15 years old, his father, Ara Arax, was murdered. Decades later, out of a compulsion to solve his father's murder, he spent seven years writing a book on the subject. This is what Mark Arax does: He investigates and parses tragedy and weaves a coherent tale around it. This, it appears, is what he's compelled to do. But the problem with these essays is that they presume to be much more than investigative reporting. Arax tries to tease poetic and sometimes political significance out of what are essentially short, well-reported vignettes, and sometimes he tries too hard. "Strange as it sounds," he writes at one point, "the war on terror and the war in Iraq were playing out with a particular intensity in the raisin capital of the world." Is it just my Southern Californian bias, or is it hard to imagine Fresno -- Arax's hometown -- as being the provincial epicenter of post-9/11 America? Desperate to find meaning in the details, Arax can produce trite commentary in breathless prose. Musing on the decline of social activism since the 1960s, he says, "I only knew that when I strolled across People's Park and onto the Berkeley campus and finally found the steps of Sproul Hall, there wasn't one man raging to thousands about throwing his body onto the gears of the machine but thousands, en masse, heedless, staring into the iridescence of their cell phones." At its best, "West of the West" is a jumble of colorful moments and characters, but if it was California that Arax was after, the bear got away. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

In an age when footpads and fogle-snatchers meant a man of breeding took his life in his hands when walking across town, a martial arts craze took hold that did not escape Conan-Doyle's keen eye for research. Schools sprung up all over London, chief among which was E.W. Barton-Wright's "Bartitsu" method. <i>The Sherlock Holmes School of Self-Defence</i> commemorates Barton-Wright's exploits and the fighting techniques of the famous sleuth himself (though Conan-Doyle mischiveously spelled it Baristu). Learn how to defend yourself with an overcoat, cane, or umbrella, or even to wield your bicycle against an attacker. Wonderful illustrations based on original photographs instruct the reader in skills that range from the sublime to the elementary.</p><p>E.W Barton-Wright (1860 -1951) studied jiu-jitsu and judo in Japan during the 1890&#39;s and went on to set up a school in England teaching a hybrid form of oriental and European self-defence he called Bartitsu.</p><h2>Divine Guidance: How to Have a Dialogue with God and Your Guardian Angels</h2><p><p>The same methods I [teach] my workshop audiences are in this book.

Easy access to a gun and whiskey coupled with gambling was the cause of most gunfights--few of which bore any resemblance to the gentlemanly duel of earlier times. . . . Hickok&#x2019;s gunfights were unusual in that most of them were &#x2018;fair&#x2019; fights, not just killings resulting from rage, jealousy over a woman, or drunkenness. And, the majority of his encounters were in his role as lawman or as an individual upholding the law.&#x201d;--from Wild Bill Hickok, Gunfighter</p> <p>Wild Bill Hickok (1837&#x2013;1876) was a Civil War spy and scout, Indian fighter, gambler, and peace officer. He was also one of the greatest gunfighters in the West. His peers referred to his reflexes as &#x201c;phenomenal&#x201d; and to his skill with a pistol as &#x201c;miraculous.&#x201d; In Wild Bill Hickok, Gunfighter, Joseph G. Rosa, the world&#x2019;s foremost authority on Hickok, provides an informative examination of Hickok&#x2019;s many gunfights.</p> <p>Rosa describes the types of guns used by Hickok and illustrates his use of the plains&#x2019; style of &#x201c;quick draw,&#x201d; as well as examining other elements of the Hickok legend. He even reconsiders the infamous &#x201c;dead man&#x2019;s hand&#x201d; allegedly held by Hickok when he was shot to death at age thirty-nine while playing poker. Numerous photographs and drawings accompany Rosa&#x2019;s down-to-earth text.</p></p><p><p><b>Joseph G.

It is a tradition that may at times, for Christians, feel strangely familiar and will, for Christians and Jews, always challenge you to see yourself and your world through a new lens."<br>&#x2015;from the Introduction</p></blockquote><p>Jewish spirituality is an approach to life that encourages us to become aware of God's presence and purpose, even in unlikely places. &#x201c;This world and everything in it is a manifestation of God&#x2019;s presence,&#x201d; says Rabbi Lawrence Kushner. &#x201c;Our challenge and goal is to find it and then act in such a way as to help others find it too.&#x201d;</p><p>In this special book, Kushner guides Christians through the rich wisdom of Jewish spirituality. He tailors his unique style to address Christians&#x2019; questions, and, in doing so, opens new windows on their own faith.</p><p><em>Jewish Spirituality </em>is a window into the Jewish soul that people of all faiths can understand and enjoy. From the Talmud and Torah, to &#x201c;repentence&#x201d; (<em>teshuva</em>) and &#x201c;repairing the world&#x201d; (<em>tikkun olam</em>), Kushner shows all of us how we can use the fundamentals of Jewish spirituality to enrich our own lives.</p></p><p>One of the defining religious trends of our time is the gradual reconciliation of Christianity and Judaism, which usually takes the form of churches (most notably, the Vatican) accepting responsibility for the anti-Semitic aspects of their worship, theology, and history. No amount of official proclamation, however, can reconcile these religions until individual Christians and Jews recognize their common religious heritage and learn to respect the differences between their traditions. <i>Jewish Spirituality: A Brief Introduction for Christians</i> is an important resource for cultivating such awareness. The author, Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, has long been known for his sophisticated, accessible books on Jewish spirituality (including <i>Honey from the Rock</i> and <i>God Was in This Place and I, I Did Not Know</i>). His definition of spirituality, which loops and spirals in rabbinic fashion, includes the following observations: "Spirituality is religion experienced intimately.... Spirituality is where you and God meet--and what you do about it." And Jewish spirituality, he writes, is distinguished as "an approach to life in which we strive to become aware of God's presence and purpose--even and especially in what might strike the casual observer as gross or material things." This, he points out, is a fact that bridges the gap between Judaism and Christianity: the incarnation of Christ, as one pastor explains to Kushner, demands that believers "continuously seek to find God in every person." Beginning with a summary of Jewish ideas about Creation, and then exploring topics such as the Torah, the Commandments, and the nature of God, Kushner expertly defines many of the similarities and differences between the religions. His lively, storytelling style makes <i>Jewish Spirituality</i> a pleasurable and challenging book that would serve well as a personal devotional, a Bible-study or Sunday-school text, or an occasion for Jewish and Christian friends to set aside time to learn more about each other's faith. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p><strong>Lawrence Kushner</strong>, author, lecturer and spiritual leader, is regarded as one of the most creative religious thinkers and writers in America. A commentator on National Public Radio's <em>All Things Considered,</em> he has focused us on spiritual renewal with wisdom and humor. Through his books and lectures, people of every faith and background have found inspiration and new strength for spiritual search and growth. It has been said that some spiritual leaders blend religion and psychology to help us walk better on the ground, but Lawrence Kushner draws on the wisdom of the mystics to help us dance better on the ceiling.</p><p>Kushner's acclaimed books include <em>I&#x2019;m God; You&#x2019;re Not: Observations on Organized Religion &amp; Other Disguises of the Ego</em>; <em>Honey from the Rock: An Easy Introduction to Jewish Mysticism</em>;<em> Invisible Lines of Connection: Sacred Stories of the Ordinary</em>;<em> The Book of Letters: A Mystical Hebrew Alphabet</em>;<em> Jewish Spirituality: A Brief Introduction for Christians</em>;<em> </em>and<em> In God&#x2019;s Hands</em>, an inspiring fable for children, with Gary Schmidt (all Jewish Lights).</p><p>Kushner served as rabbi at Congregation Beth El in Sudbury, Massachusetts, for almost thirty years; he is currently the Emanu-El scholar at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco, and an adjunct faculty member at Hebrew Union College&#x2013;Jewish Institute of Religion. He is fascinated by graphic design and computers (designing most of his Jewish Lights books). He enjoys Mozart, hanging around sailboats, and making his granddaughters giggle.</p></p><h2>Defending Boyhood: How Building Forts, Reading Stories, Playing Ball, and Praying to God Can Change the World</h2><p>Western civilization has no more eloquent defender than Anthony Esolen, a man who has counted the cost, and paid it, of leading the way in that defense. Following on his compelling prior volume, <i>Defending Marriage: Twelve Arguments for Sanity</i>, Professor Esolen returns, this time in defense of boys and an experience of boyhood that is on the wane, if not extinguished in many quarters of the modern world&#x2014;and to illuminate the threats our precious sons face from harridans, harpies, and all purveyors and promoters of political correctness and of the misguided and ultimately doomed-though not before it has done much mischief-project of blurring the distinctions between boys and girls.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on his own, in many ways all-American boyhood, Esolen, at times wistfully, at times, playfully, and at times prophetically&#x2014;in the literal sense of employing the thunder of an Old Testament prophet, details what a good boyhood once was and what it can be again. He does so in chapters inspiringly titled:<br> &nbsp;<br> The Arena to Enter<br> Brothers to Gather<br> Mountains to Climb<br> The Man to Follow<br> Work to Do<br> Songs to Sing<br> Enemies to Slay<br> Life to Give<br><br> &nbsp;<br> Anthony Esolen prescribes a return to sanity to an insane world. He may not be able to change the world, but enter into the world of boyhood with him and he just might change you and the lives of the boys you love.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Anthony Esolen is a professor of English and a writer in residence at Thomas More College in Merrimack, New Hampshire. A senior editor of Touchstone magazine, Professor Esolen is one of western civilization&#x2019;s staunchest and most prolific defenders, He has published magnificent translations of classic works, cultural commentary such as this book and its predecessor Defending Marriage, as well as titles more whimsical (Angels, Barbarians, and Nincompoops and a lot of other words you thought you knew). &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Opal: The Journal of an Understanding Heart</h2><p>A lyrical, lovely, and deeply touching adaptation of an authentic journal kept by an orphaned six-year-old girl--later believed to be a French princess--living in an Oregon lumber camp at the turn of the century. <b>24 black-and-white photographs.</b></p><p><b>Opal Whiteley</b> grew up in logging settlements near the town of Cottage Grove, at the southern end of Oregon's Willamette Valley.

Born near San Francisco in 1915 and raised in Ontario, Millar returned to the U.S. as a young man and published his first novel in 1944. He served as the president of the Mystery Writers of America and was awarded their Grand Master Award as well as the Mystery Writers of Great Britain&#39;s Gold Dagger Award. He died in 1983.Chapter 1THE Channel Club lay on a shelf of rock overlooking the sea, toward the southern end of the beach called Malibu. Above its long brown buildings, terraced gardens climbed like a richly carpeted stairway to the highway. The grounds were surrounded by a high wire fence topped with three barbed strands and masked with oleanders.I stopped in front of the gate and sounded my horn. A man wearing a blue uniform and an official-looking peaked cap came out of the stone gatehouse. His hair was black and bushy below the cap, sprinkled with gray like iron filings. In spite of his frayed ears and hammered-in nose, his head had the combination of softness and strength you see in old Indian faces. His skin was dark.&#34;I seen you coming,&#34; he said amiably. &#34;You didden have to honk, it hurts the ears.&#34;&#34;Sorry.&#34;&#34;It&#39;s all right.&#34; He shuffled forward, his belly overhanging the belt that supported his holster, and leaned a confidential arm on the car door. &#34;What&#39;s your business, mister?&#34;&#34;Mr. Bassett called me. He didn&#39;t state his business. The name is Archer.&#34;&#34;Yah, sure, he is expecting you. You can drive right on down. He&#39;s in his office.&#34;He turned to the reinforced wire gate, jangling his keyring. A man came out of the oleanders and ran past my car. He was a big young man in a blue suit, hatless, with flying pink hair. He ran almost noiselessly on his toes toward the opening gate.The guard moved quickly for a man of his age. He whirled and got an arm around the young man&#39;s middle. The young man struggled in his grip, forcing the guard back against the gatepost. He said something guttural and inarticulate. His shoulder jerked, and he knocked the guard&#39;s cap off.The guard leaned against the gatepost and fumbled for his gun. His eyes were small and dirty like the eyes of a potato. Blood began to drip from the end of his nose and spotted his blue shirt where it curved out over his belly. His revolver came up in his hand. I got out of my car.The young man stood where he was, his head turned sideways, halfway through the gate. His profile was like something chopped out of raw planking, with a glaring blue eye set in its corner. He said:&#34;I&#39;m going to see Bassett. You can&#39;t stop me.&#34;&#34;A slug in the guts will stop you,&#34; the guard said in a reasonable way. &#34;You move, I shoot. This is private property.&#34;&#34;Tell Bassett I want to see him.&#34;&#34;I already told him. He don&#39;t want to see you.&#34; The guard shuffled forward, his left shoulder leading, the gun riding steady in his right hand. &#34;Now pick up my hat and hand it to me and git.&#34;The young man stood still for a while. Then he stooped and picked up the cap and brushed at it ineffectually before he handed it back.&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to hit you. I&#39;ve nothing against you.&#34;&#34;I got something against you, boy.&#34; The guard snatched the cap out of his hands. &#34;Now beat it before I knock your block off.&#34;I touched the young man&#39;s shoulder, which was broad and packed with muscle. &#34;You better do what he says.&#34;He turned to me, running his hand along the side of his jaw. His jaw was heavy and pugnacious. In spite of this, his light eyebrows and uncertain mouth made his face seem formless. He sneered at me very youngly:&#34;Are you another one of Bassett&#39;s muscle boys?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t know Bassett.&#34;&#34;I heard you ask for him.&#34;&#34;I do know this. Run around calling people names and pushing in where you&#39;re not wanted, and you&#39;ll end up with a flat profile. Or worse.&#34;He closed his right fist and looked from it to my face. I shifted my weight a little, ready to block and counter.&#34;Is that supposed to be a threat?&#34; he said.&#34;It&#39;s a friendly warning. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s eating you. My advice is go away and forget it--&#34;&#34;Not without seeing Bassett.&#34;&#34;And, for God&#39;s sake, keep your hands off old men.&#34;&#34;I apologized for that.&#34; But he flushed guiltily. The guard came up behind him and poked him with the revolver. &#34;Apology not accepted. I used to could handle two like you with one arm tied behind me. Now are you going to git or do I have to show you?&#34;&#34;I&#39;ll go,&#34; the young man said over his shoulder. &#34;Only, you can&#39;t keep me off the public highway. And sooner or later he has to come out.&#34;&#34;What&#39;s your beef with Bassett?&#34; I said.&#34;I don&#39;t care to discuss it with a stranger. I&#39;ll discuss it with him.&#34; He looked at me for a long moment, biting his lower lip. &#34;Would you tell him I&#39;ve got to see him? That it&#39;s very important to me?&#34;&#34;I guess I can tell him that. Who do I say the message is from?&#34;&#34;George Wall. I&#39;m from Toronto.&#34; He paused. &#34;It&#39;s about my wife. Tell him I won&#39;t leave until he sees me.&#34;&#34;That&#39;s what you think,&#34; the guard said. &#34;March now, take a walk.&#34;George Wall retreated up the road, moving slowly to show his independence. He dragged his long morning shadow around a curve and out of sight. The guard put his gun away and wiped his bloody nose with the back of his hand. Then he licked his hand, as though he couldn&#39;t afford to waste the protein.&#34;The guy&#39;s a cycle-path what they call them,&#34; he said. &#34;Mr. Bassett don&#39;t know him, even.&#34;&#34;Is he what Bassett wants to see me about?&#34;&#34;Maybe, I dunno.&#34; His arms and shoulders moved in a sinuous shrug.&#34;How long has he been hanging around?&#34;&#34;Ever since I come onto the gate. For all I know, he spent the night in the bushes. I ought to have him picked up, but Mr. Bassett says no. Mr. Bassett is too softhearted for his own good. Handle him yourself, he says, we don&#39;t want trouble with law.&#34;&#34;You handled him.&#34;&#34;You bet you. Time was, I could take on two like him, like I said.&#34; He flexed the muscle in his right arm and palpated it admiringly. He gave me a gentle smile. &#34;I was a fighter one time--pretty good fighter. Tony Torres? You ever hear my name? The Fresno Gamecock?&#34;&#34;I&#39;ve heard it. You went six with Armstrong.&#34;&#34;Yes.&#34; He nodded solemnly. &#34;I was an old man already, thirty-five, thirty-six. My legs was gone. He cut my legs off from under me or I could of lasted ten. I felt fine, only my legs. You know that? You saw the fight?&#34;&#34;I heard it on the radio. I was a kid in school, I couldn&#39;t make the price.&#34;&#34;What do you know?&#34; he said with dreamy pleasure. You heard it on the radio.&#34;chapter 2I LEFT my car on the asphalt parking-lot in front of the main building. A Christmas tree painted brilliant red hung upside-down over the entrance. It was a flat-roofed structure of fieldstone and wood. Its Neutraesque low lines and simplicity of design kept me from seeing how big it was until I was inside. Through the inner glass door of the vestibule I could see the fifty-yard swimming-pool contained in its U-shaped wings. The ocean end opened on bright blue space.The door was locked. The only human being in sight was a black boy bisected by narrow white trunks. He was sweeping the floor of the pool with a long-handled underwater vacuum. I tapped on the door with a coin.After a while he heard me and came trotting. His dark, intelligent eyes surveying me through the glass seemed to divide the world into two groups: the rich, and the not so rich. I qualified for the second group, it seemed. He said when he opened the door:&#34;If you&#39;re selling, mister, the timing could be better. This is the off-season, anyway, and Mr. Bassett&#39;s in a rotten mood. He just got through chopping me out. It isn&#39;t my fault they threw the tropical fish in the swimming-pool.&#34;&#34;Who did?&#34;&#34;The people last night. The chlorine water killed them, poor little beggars, so I got to suck them out.&#34;&#34;The people?&#34;&#34;The tropical fish. They scooped &#39;em out of the aquarium and chunked &#39;em in the pool. People go out on a party and get drunk, they forget all the ordinary decencies of life. So Mr. Bassett takes it out on me.&#34;&#34;Don&#39;t hold it against him. My clients are always in a rotten mood when they call me in.&#34;&#34;You an undertaker or something?&#34;&#34;Something.&#34;&#34;I just wondered.&#34; A white smile lit his face. &#34;I got an aunt in the undertaking business. I can&#39;t see it myself. Too creepy. But she enjoys it.&#34;&#34;Good. Is Bassett the owner here?&#34;&#34;Naw, just the manager. The way he talks, you&#39;d think he owns it, but it belongs to the members.&#34;I followed his wedge-shaped lifeguard&#39;s back along the gallery, through shifting green lights reflected from the pool. He knocked on a gray door with a MANAGER sign. A high voice answered the knock. It creaked along my spine like chalk on a damp blackboard:&#34;Who is it, please?&#34;&#34;Archer,&#34; I said to the lifeguard.&#34;Mr. Archer to see you, sir.&#34;&#34;Very well. One moment.&#34;The lifeguard winked at me and trotted away, his feet slapping the tiles. The lock snicked, and the door was opened slightly. A face appeared in the crack, just below the level of my own. Its eyes were pale and set too wide apart; they bulged a little like the eyes of a fish. The thin, spinsterly mouth emitted a sigh:&#34;I am glad to see you. Do come in.&#34;He relocked the door behind me and waved me to a chair in front of his desk. The gesture was exaggerated by nerves. He sat down at the desk, opened a pigskin pouch, and began to stuff a big-pot briar with dark flakes of English tobacco. This and his Harris tweed jacket, his Oxford slacks, his thick-soled brown brogues, his Eastern-seaboard accent, were all of a piece. In spite of the neat dye job on his brown hair, and the unnatural youth which high color lent his face, I placed his age close to sixty.I looked around the office. It was windowless, lit by hidden fluorescence and ventilated by an air-conditioning system. The furniture was dark and heavy. The walls were hung with photographs of yachts under full sail, divers in the air, tennis-players congratulating each other with forced smiles on their faces. There were several books on the desk, held upright between elephant bookends made of polished black stone.Bassett applied a jet lighter to his pipe and laid down a blue smoke screen, through which he said:&#34;I understand, Mr. Archer, that you&#39;re a qualified bodyguard.&#34;&#34;I suppose I&#39;m qualified. I don&#39;t often take on that kind of work.&#34;&#34;But I understood-- Why not?&#34;&#34;It means living at close quarters with some of the damnedest jerks. They usually want a bodyguard because they can&#39;t get anybody to talk to them. Or else they have delusions.&#34;He smiled crookedly. &#34;I can hardly take that as a compliment. Or perhaps I wasn&#39;t intended to?&#34;&#34;You&#39;re in the market for a bodyguard?&#34;&#34;I hardly know.&#34; He added carefully: &#34;Until the situation shapes up more clearly, I really can&#39;t say what I need. Or why.&#34;&#34;Who gave you my name?&#34;&#34;One of our members mentioned you to me some time ago. Joshua Severn, the television producer. You&#39;ll be interested to know that he considers you quite a fireball.&#34;&#34;Uh-huh.&#34; The trouble with flattery was that people expected to be paid for it in kind. &#34;Why do you need a detective, Mr. Bassett?&#34;&#34;I&#39;ll tell you. A certain young chap has threatened my--threatened my safety. You should have heard him on the telephone.&#34;&#34;You&#39;ve talked to him?&#34;&#34;Just for a minute, last night. I was in the midst of a party--our annual post-Christmas party--and he called from Los Angeles. He said he was going to come over here and assault me unless I gave him certain information. It jarred me frightfully.&#34;&#34;What kind of information?&#34;&#34;Information which I simply don&#39;t possess. I believe he&#39;s outside now, lying in wait for me. The party didn&#39;t break up until very late and I spent the night here, what remained of it. This morning the gateman telephoned down that he had a young man there who wished to see me. I told him to keep the fellow out. Shortly after that, when I&#39;d gathered my wits together, I telephoned you.&#34;&#34;And what do you want me to do, exactly?&#34;&#34;Get rid of him. You must have ways and means. I don&#39;t want any violence, of course, unless it should prove to be absolutely necessary.&#34; His eyes gleamed palely between new strata of smoke. &#34;It may be necessary. Do you have a gun?&#34;&#34;In my car. It&#39;s not for hire.&#34;&#34;Of course not. You misinterpret my meaning, old boy. Perhaps I didn&#39;t express myself quite clearly. I yield to no man in my abhorrence of violence. I merely meant that you might have use for a pistol as an--ah--instrument of persuasion. Couldn&#39;t you simply escort him to the station, or the airfield, and put him aboard a plane?&#34;&#34;No.&#34; I stood up.He followed me to the door and took hold of my arm. I disliked the coziness, and shook him off.&#34;Look here, Archer, I&#39;m not a wealthy man, but I do have some savings. I&#39;m willing to pay you three hundred dollars to dispose of this fellow for me.&#34;&#34;Dispose of him?&#34;&#34;Without violence, of course.&#34;&#34;Sorry, no sale.&#34;&#34;Five hundred dollars.&#34;&#34;It can&#39;t be done. What you want me to do is merely kidnapping under California law.&#34;&#34;Good Lord, I didn&#39;t mean that.&#34; He was genuinely shocked.&#34;Think about it. For a man in your position, you&#39;re pretty dim about law. Let the police take care of him, why don&#39;t you? You say he threatened you.&#34;&#34;Yes. As a matter of fact, he mentioned horse-whipping. But you can&#39;t go to the police with that sort of thing.&#34;&#34;Sure you can.&#34;&#34;Not I. It&#39;s so ridiculously old-fashioned. I&#39;d be the laughingstock of the entire Southland. You don&#39;t seem to grasp the personal aspects, old boy. I&#39;m manager and secretary of a very, very exclusive club. The finest people on the coast confide their children, their young daughters, to my trust. I have to be clear of any breath of scandal--Calpurnia, you know.&#34;&#34;Where does the scandal come in?&#34;Calpurnia took his pipe out of his mouth and blew a wobbly smoke-ring. &#34;I&#39;d hoped to avoid going into it. I certainly didn&#39;t expect to be cross-questioned on the subject. However. Something has to be done, before the situation deteriorates irreparably.&#34;</p><h2>Do You Have Kids?: Life When the Answer Is No</h2><p>A savvy and validating guide to what might be in store for growing numbers of childfree and childless adults worldwide, <i>Do You Have Kids? Life When the Answer is No</i> takes on topics from the shifting meaning of family to what we leave behind when we die. Weaving together wisdom from women ages twenty-four to ninety-one with both her own story and a growing body of research, Kate brings to light alternate routes to lives of meaning, connection, and joy.<br>Today about one in five American women will never have children, whether by choice or by destiny. Yet few women talk much about what not having kids means to their lives and identities. Not that they don&#x2019;t want to; there just aren&#x2019;t obvious catalysts for such open conversations. In fact, social taboos preclude exploration of the topic&#x2015;and since our family-centric culture doesn&#x2019;t know quite what to do with non-parents, there&#x2019;s potential for childless and childfree women to be sidelined, ignored, or drowned out. Yet there&#x2019;s widespread, pent-up demand for understanding and validating this perfectly normal way of being. In this straight-shooting, exhaustively researched book, women without kids talk candidly about the ways in which their lives differ from societal norms and expectations&#x2015;the good, the bad, and the unexpected.</p><p>Kate Kaufmann embarked on her life as a non-mom when she abandoned fertility treatments, quit her corporate job, and moved from the suburbs to a rural community to raise sheep. Since 2012, she has talked with hundreds of women ranging in age from twenty-four to ninety-one and advocates for better understanding of the childless/childfree demographic. Kate received an MFA in creative writing in 2016 from the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts and has a professional background in corporate staffing, training, and consulting. She&#39;s lived in various urban, suburban, rural, and coastal communities and currently calls Portland, Oregon home. Her writing has appeared most recently in the Washington Post.

Indeed, this relatively small group of twenty-seven works, written during the height of the Roman Empire, not only helped create and sustain a vast world religion, but also have been integral to the larger cultural dynamics of the West, above and beyond particular religious expressions.<br><br>Looking at the New Testament through the lens of literary study, Kyle Keefer offers an engrossing exploration of this revered religious text as a work of literature, but also keeps in focus its theological ramifications. Unique among books that examine the Bible as literature, this brilliantly compact introduction offers an intriguing double-edged look at this universal text--a religiously informed literary analysis. The book first explores the major sections of the New Testament--the gospels, Paul's letters, and Revelation--as individual literary documents. Keefer shows how, in such familiar stories as the parable of the Good Samaritan, a literary analysis can uncover an unexpected complexity to what seems a simple, straightforward tale. At the conclusion of the book, Keefer steps back and asks questions about the New Testament as a whole. He reveals that whether read as a single document or as a collection of works, the New Testament presents readers with a wide variety of forms and viewpoints, and a literary exploration helps bring this richness to light. <br><br>A fascinating investigation of the New Testament as a classic literary work, this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> uses a literary framework--plot, character, narrative arc, genre--to illuminate the language, structure, and the crafting of this venerable text.<br><br><strong>About the Series</strong>: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style,<strong> Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics. Written by experts for the newcomer, they demonstrate the finest contemporary thinking about the central problems and issues in hundreds of key topics, from philosophy to Freud, quantum theory to Islam.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kyle Keefer</strong> is Assistant Professor of Religion at Converse College, in Spartanburg, South Carolina.<br><br>"Keefer successfully, and often brilliantly, embarks specifically on a series of literary readings of the books of the New Testament, which are accessible, provocative and theologically highly suggestive... This will be an excellent book for students beginning with the study of the Bible, but also for the general reader, its scholarship unobtrusive but certain, its tone simple but never patronizing... I look forward to encouraging my students to read this book as a sure first step in their coming to understand the New Testament as literature."--David Jasper, University of Glasgow, <em>Literature</em> <em>and Theology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The French Revolution (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Thomas Carlyle's history of the French Revolution opens with the death of Louis XV in 1774 and ends with Napoleon suppressing the insurrection of the 13th Vendemaire.

Key to this practice is the understanding that the problems faced by an individual are rooted in the inequalities and oppression of the socio-political structure of society rather than in personal characteristics or individual choices. Moreover, the contributors show that social justice and social change &#x2014; working against racism, sexism and class oppression &#x2014; can and must be a key component of social work practice.</p> <p>Drawing on concrete examples from specific practice contexts, personal experience and case work, including child welfare, poverty, mental health, addictions and disability, the contributors demonstrate how to translate social justice theory into everyday practice.</p> <p>This new edition adds chapters on working with refugee, immigrant and racialized families; children; older adults; cognitive behavioural therapy; and using social media as a tool for social change.</p></p><p><p>Donna Baines is Associate Professor of Social Work and Labour Studies at McMaster University.

Selected passages in translation are accompanied by Gardner's comments, which incorporate selections from the commentary and interpretation of the renowned Neo-Confucian thinker, Zhu Xi (1130-1200).</p><p>This study provides an ideal introduction to the basic texts in the Confucian tradition from the twelfth through the twentieth centuries. It guides the reader through Zhu Xi's influential interpretation of the Four Books, showing how Zhu, through the genre of commentary, gave new coherence and meaning to these foundational texts. Since the Four Books with Zhu Xi's commentary served as the basic textbook for Chinese schooling and the civil service examinations for more than seven hundred years, this book illustrates as well the nature of the standard Chinese educational curriculum.</p></p><p>Daniel K. Gardner is the Dwight W. Morrow Professor of History at Smith College.<p>Daniel Gardner's <i>The Four Books</i> was perfect for my upper-division lecture course on Late Imperial China, and would also work well in an introductory class on the same period, anything from Song through Qing; or in an introductory week or two on pre-modern China or East Asia in a modern China or modern East Asia history or political science course. [Gardner] has designed this book for undergraduates and it is clearly written and easy to read. His introduction and conclusion are both clear and helpful. The introduction makes the key points students need to understand the place of the Four Books in late imperial society and government, and in intellectual history. The pictures illustrative particular points well, and the reproduced page of text plus commentary vividly shows students how the commentary was built right in. The conclusion reiterates important points about the overall message of the Four Books, pulling together examples from all of them: this is useful for students encountering the texts for the first time. In between, the presentation of the Great Learning and the selection of passages from the other Books, enriched as late imperial readers would have had them by commentary, is judicious. Of course every teacher will have her own favorite passages that have been omitted, but Gardner has chosen wisely to make the most important points. . . .

Edmund, Earl of Amberley, is bold and sensual, tempting Alexandra to be reckless for the first time in her life.

Now a woman who craves her freedom above all else is about to discover how far one man will go to protect and possess the woman he loves....</p><p><i>The New York Times</i> bestselling, multi-award winning author Mary Balogh grew up in Wales, land of sea and mountains, song and legend. She brought music and a vivid imagination with her when she came to Canada to teach. There she began a second career as a writer of books that always end happily and always celebrate the power of love. There are over four million copies of her Regency romances and historical romances in print.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br><br>It was a bitterly cold night for early May. It was not actually raining, but there was a heavy cloud cover, and the strong wind felt like a thousand knives to the scantily clad young lady who walked alone into its teeth. The thin dark cloak that she wore over an even thinner ball gown seemed like no protection at all, though she held it closed at the front with one hand and huddled inside it. The other hand held the loose sides of the hood tight beneath her chin.<br><br>Alexandra Purnell shivered and lowered her head. But she did not turn back to the ballroom behind her, despite the inviting glow of hundreds of candles through the long windows and the memory of scores of gay, brightly dressed guests. And despite the fact that the room she had just left was warm&#x2013;perhaps even a little too warm, as the French doors into the garden had been firmly closed against the inclement weather.<br><br>No, foolish as it seemed, Alexandra preferred the discomfort of a solitary walk in the garden to the pleasures of the ballroom&#x2013;for a short time anyway. In fact, she almost welcomed the weather just as it was. If it were warmer or less windy, doubtless there would be any number of guests strolling outside, and she would be unable to find any solitude at all.<br><br>She glanced back over her shoulder, but there was no one behind her. And there were no accusing faces at the French windows watching her make her temporary escape. Even so, she instinctively moved farther away from the lights of the house and closer to the dark back alley across from the stable block. It seemed that London dwellers were doomed either to live at some remove from their own stables or else to have them almost on top of the house.<br><br>Alexandra shivered again, and burrowed her chin behind the hand that held her hood firmly closed. She blew warm air down into her clasped hand. It was doubtless foolish to have run away like this. Her slippers were probably stained with grass. And her smooth chignon, which she had insisted upon despite Nanny Rey's plea that she try a hair fashion more suited to the festive occasion, would be flattened and disheveled by the close-held hood. And she certainly could not escape for an indefinite period. She would have to go back soon.<br><br>She was one-and-twenty years old already, she told herself in an interior monologue that had become very familiar to her mind over the past weeks. She was in her first and perhaps her only really active Season in London, which involved her in all the diversions of the <i>beau monde</i>. Papa had decided, quite without warning, that she must be given a proper introduction to society before her long-planned betrothal to the Duke of Peterleigh became official. They had taken a house on Curzon Street&#x2013;Papa, Mama, her brother James, and herself. And they had met all the right people and attended all the proper functions in the month since.<br><br>She should be happy. Most young ladies would be ecstatic to be in her position. But she felt positively in her dotage beside all the other young girls who were making their come-out. And she could not feel comfortable with such a life. Nothing in her past had prepared her for the gaiety and frivolity of London. She was only now beginning to realize fully what a very strict and narrow upbringing she and James had had at Dunstable Hall. Almost any form of entertainment and personal pleasure had been frowned upon by Papa. Every thought and word and action had revolved around church and the Scriptures and Papa's firmly held notions of virtue and morality. And unlike James, she had not even been to school to discover that there was another world beyond home.<br><br>She had been intended for the Duke of Peterleigh for as far back as she could remember. She had met him only on a few occasions and then very briefly and formally. He did not live often on his estate, which adjoined theirs. He was twenty years her senior and spent most of his time in London on government business.<br><br>Alexandra had never questioned the fact that she would marry him when the time came. And she still did not do so. They had met a few times since her arrival in London, and she had found nothing to censure in him. He was in many ways like her father&#x2013;stern and severe in manner, it was true, but surely an honest and an upright man. Unfortunately, he was also a busy man and did not appear at nearly as many entertainments as she was expected to attend.<br><br>And so there was an awkwardness about her come-out. She did not feel any affinity with the members of society around her. And she was not in search of a husband, or a flirt, as most of the other girls seemed to be. Papa did not like her to dress quite as fashionably as the others, and she could not bring herself even to dress her hair in a pretty fashion.<br><br>And there were the Harding-Smythes to contend with almost wherever she went. They kept her constantly aware of her inadequacies. Her aunt Deirdre, Papa's sister, always assumed that she lacked amusement and went out of her way to provide it. Her efforts were kindly meant, perhaps, but her ideas of amusement were not Alexandra's. Her cousin Caroline simpered and clung, more in an attempt to attract James than out of any real affection for her, Alexandra felt. And Cousin Albert appeared to have set himself the task of protecting an innocent young country cousin from all the evils and temptations of London. His manner toward her, toplofty and condescending, irritated her beyond bearing.<br><br>Alexandra blew again onto her cold hand. Had she been very rude to Caroline and Aunt Deirdre earlier? Did she owe them an apology? They had wanted her to return home with them that night so that she might accompany them to the shops on Bond Street the next morning. They had even secured her mother's permission before coming to ask her and had arranged to have a maid bring suitable clothes for her to wear the next day. But she had refused their invitation. She had not even softened her abruptness by offering some sort of excuse. She had been taught too well that telling the truth is always a virtue and that there is no such thing as a white lie.<br><br>They had left the ball soon after her refusal, as Aunt Deirdre had a headache. And at the same time she had been unable to resist the temptation to rescue her cloak and step outside for a moment's peace, especially as Albert had been smirking at her from across the room, and she knew he would come soon, remark on the singular misfortune of her having no dancing partner, and condescend to lead her out himself. Probably Mama still thought that she had gone with Aunt Deirdre. She really should be returning to the ballroom. Someone had signed her card for a set of country dances. She must not pay him the discourtesy of not being present when it began. Besides, Mama would scold if she were absent for a noticeable length of time and perhaps even report the fact to Papa the next morning. Then there would be trouble.<br><br>But Alexandra was fated not to return after all. As she was about to turn back to the house, she glanced almost absentmindedly at a closed carriage that was being drawn by four horses into the alley before the stable block just a short distance away.<br><br>And then the nightmare began.<br><br>Her back prickled to the knowledge that someone had stepped up behind her only a fraction of a second before a hand clamped over her mouth. Terror engulfed her instantly as she clawed at the hand and kicked back at her assailant with one slippered foot.<br><br>But her hands were soon dragged from her face and pulled firmly behind her back. Her cloak fell open so that the wind blew all its chill force against the delicate silk of her blue ball gown. She tried to shake her head, bend forward, kick herself free. But her efforts were all to no avail. Her hood had somehow been pulled down over her nose so that she could not even see.<br><br>"Got you!" a male voice said from behind her in tones of breathless amusement. "No use to struggle anymore now, young lady. You'll not be going such a long distance tonight after all. You should have stayed dancing. What in the deuce are you doing, Clem? Don't you have her wrists bound yet?"<br><br>"She is struggling like six cats," another voice said. "There. That should hold right and tight."<br><br>"Get the scarf for her mouth then," the first voice said. "We don't have all night, you know. A pretty pickle we would be in if she set up a screeching and we were caught. We could end up swinging."<br><br>"Swing yourself!" the second voice said indignantly. "I'm just doing this as a favor to a friend. I ain't in the habit of kidnapping females, y'know."<br><br>But Alexandra was not listening to the conversation. As he talked, the second man was stretching a scarf tightly over her mouth and tying it in a tight knot at the back of her head. And her hood was still down over her nose, so that she felt as if she were being bound in a sack. Renewed terror set her to kicking with fresh vigor and pulling uselessly against whatever it was that held her hands imprisoned.<br><br>"Grab her feet, Clem, will you," the first man said, "before my shins start getting bruises on top of bruises!"<br><br>And Alexandra was lifted unceremoniously from the ground and dumped none too gently inside what she realized must be the carriage she had seen pull out into the alley.<br><br>"There are limits to friendship," the first man grumbled before slamming the door and leaving Alexandra alone inside the dark interior of the coach. "Next time Eden has a wild scheme like this to execute, he can damned well do it himself."<br><br>The coach lurched into motion, and Alexandra realized that she was lying on a seat that must normally be exceedingly comfortable. But whose carriage was it? Who were her kidnappers, and where were they taking her? What did they plan to do with her? Ransom her? Did they imagine that Papa was a wealthy man? Murder her? She dragged again at her wrists, only to find that there was no way to loosen the bonds. She could feel the gag tight over her mouth, her hood halfway down her nose. And she began to draw fast and shallow breaths. She could not breathe. She was going to die. She was going to suffocate even before they had a chance to kill her.<br><br>Perhaps they were going to ravish her. Oh, dear God, she would rather die! Alexandra wrenched at her wrists again and found herself falling and quite unable to save herself from an awkward landing on the floor between the two seats.<br><br>The journey was not a long one. The carriage stopped, the door was thrown open, and the nightmare began again. If only she could see! She would not be so terrified if she could only see her captors and know that at least they were human.<br><br>"Oh, Lord, she fell off the seat," the first man's voice said. "Eden will have a thing or two to say if she has any bruises."<br><br>Alexandra had no chance to try once more to kick her way to freedom. Her head was toward the open door. One captor pulled her out by the arms, and she was immediately tipped forward and over the shoulder of the other, who proceeded to carry her up a flight of steps and into a lighted hallway. She could just make out a pattern of black and white tiles through the sides of her hood.<br><br>"Yes, I shall lead the way to her room," a third voice was saying. It was a stiff and disapproving voice. "But I don't like it, sirs. His lordship has never done anything quite like this before. She's all trussed up. It doesn't seem quite fitting somehow."<br><br>"Just lead the way, Palmer," the first man said breathlessly. "She ain't a featherweight."<br><br>Alexandra was bumped up a seemingly interminable flight of stairs and finally set down on her feet for a brief moment before being pushed backward quite gently. She landed on what felt like a perfectly soft bed.<br><br>"Here," her captor said, fumbling beneath her until he found the bonds at her wrists. "I can't leave you like that, now, can I? But I'll have to tie you up somehow and leave on the gag. Can't have you screeching and disturbing the whole household. And can't leave you free or you'll only run away again and all my efforts will be in vain. I'll tie your hands to the bedpost here. No offense meant. Eden will be home soon. He'll deal with you."<br><br>Alexandra's struggles were not as frenzied as they might have been. She was feeling very close to despair. If she escaped from this man, she had a whole houseful of enemies to get past before she could regain her freedom. She made only muffled protests as her hands were tied quite firmly above her head. She shook her head furiously, but she could not uncover her eyes enough to see either her assailant or the room into which he had brought her.<br><br>And then she was alone, the room quiet and dark, all sound obliterated by the closing of the door. Alone to struggle for a freedom that she knew was next to impossible to achieve. Alone with her imagination. Alone and waiting for her real captor to come. Eden. He would be there soon. Soon she would know.<br><br>Alexandra struggled on.<br>Dominic Raine, Lord Eden, blew out his breath through puffed cheeks when he returned to the ballroom from the garden and saw Madeline, his twin sister, quite close by, flanked by her bosom friends Miss Wickhill and Lady Pamela Paisley, the three of them laughing at something Lord Crane had just finished saying.<br><br>What a relief to see her there. He had made enough of a cake of himself as it was in the past hour. He had been justly served for jumping so hastily to conclusions. But it could have been worse&#x2013;a lot worse. He would never have lived the matter down if his plan for Faber and Jones to bundle Madeline off to Edmund's house had been carried out. Her wrath would have been dreadful to behold. Not to mention Edmund's.<br><br>But all was well. Provided that couple of loose screws didn't still try to abduct her from the middle of the ballroom, of course. He would not put it past those two. The more difficult the scheme, the more likely they were to take the risk. And he was no better, he had to admit. He would not be able to resist the challenge if he were in their place. He must find them. Tell them the whole thing was off.<br><br>First, though, perhaps he had better warn Madeline. Tell her the whole story in such a way that she would think it all a great joke. He fingered his neckcloth to check that it was straight and sauntered over to the group of which his sister was a part. She flashed him a smile and finished the story she was telling to an attentive group. A burst of laughter greeted her final words.</p><h2>Leading Quietly</h2><p>Most of us think of leaders as courageous risk takers, orchestrators of major events. In a word: heroes. Although such figures are inspiring, Joseph Badaracco argues that their larger-than-life accomplishments are not what makes the world work. What does, he says, is the sum of millions of small yet consequential decisions that individuals working far from the limelight make every day. Badaracco calls them &#34;quiet leaders&#34;--people who choose responsible, behind-the-scenes action over public heroism to resolve tough leadership challenges. Quiet leaders don&#39;t fit the stereotype of the bold and gutsy leader, and they don&#39;t want to. What they want is to do the &#34;right thing&#34;--for their organizations, their coworkers, and themselves--but inconspicuously and without casualties. Drawing from extensive research, Badaracco presents eight practical yet counter-intuitive guidelines for situations in which right and wrong seem like moving targets. Compelling stories illustrate how these &#34;nonheroes&#34; succeed by managing their political capital, buying themselves time, bending the rules, and more. From the executive suite to the office cubicle--Leading Quietly shows how patient, everyday efforts can add up to a better company and a better world.</p><p>"Most of us thrill to stories of heroic leaders mounting the barricades on behalf of great causes. Enter now the quiet leaders-unsung men and women who actually keep most of the world going from one day to the next. Badaracco tells their stories with enormous insight and understanding, explaining not only <i>how</i> they succeed but <i>why</i>. For those who must learn how to lead from the middle-and that's nearly everyone-reading this book is a terrific place to start."<p> -David Gergen, Director, Center for Public Leadership, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University</p><p> "Rather than seeing the road map for career success as a series of bold and courageous decisions, Badaracco makes the case for a new model of leadership based on thoughtful consideration, practicality, and pragmatism."</p><p> -Paul R. Charron, Chairman and CEO, Liz Claiborne, Inc.</p><p> "With quiet effectiveness, Badaracco's new brand of leaders take small, careful steps to solve major problems. <i>Leading Quietly</i> lays out what may seem obvious, but is in fact rocket science. This book will change the way you view leaders and perhaps yourself."</p><p> -Anne L. Bryant, Executive Director, National School Boards Association and Chairman of the Board, Simmons College</p><p> "In this useful and thoughtful book, Badaracco helps us to understand that true leadership isn't grand or heroic. It occurs in small steps by people on the ground who are guided by humility and common sense. Organizations and societies that nurture quiet leaders are bound to be more successful than those that make room only for the strong and loud ones."</p><p> -Robert B. Reich, author of <i>The Future of Success</i>, Hexter Professor of Social and Economic Policy at Brandeis University, and former U.S. Secretary of Labor</p><p> "The stories of the leaders profiled in <i>Leading Quietly</i> demonstrate how even the most seemingly ordinary decisions are not ordinary at all. Rather, they are laced with complex motives and play out on uneven political terrain that must be navigated carefully and thoughtfully for long-term success."</p><p> -Kathy Levinson, Strategic Philanthropy and Investment, and former President and Chief Operating Officer of E*TRADE Group</p><p></p>Joseph L.

There he meets the alluring stepmother of the decedant, and begins to wonder about dating a witness. Meanwile, he has been threatened with suspension by his ambitious new chief unless he leaves his beloved, if squalid, suite at the El Dorado Hotel, and moves downtown. With free housing hard to come by, Hoke is desperate to find a new place to live. His difficulties are only amplified by an assignment to re-investigate fifty unsolved murders, the unexpected arrival of his two teenage daughters, and a partner struggling with an unwanted pregnancy. With few options and even fewer dollars, he decides that the suspicious and beautiful stepmother of the dead junkie might be a compromised solution to all of his problems.<br><br>Packed with atmosphere and humor, <i>New Hope for the Dead </i>is a classic murder mystery by one of the true masters of the genre. Now back in print, Charles Willeford&#x2019;s tour de force is an irresistible invitation to become acquainted with one of the greatest detective characters of all time.</p><p>New Hope For The Dead<p>"Nobody Writes Like Charles Willeford...He Is An Original -- Funny, Weird And Wonderful."</p><p>-- James Crumley</p><p>"Pure Pleasure...Mr. Willeford Never Puts A Foot Wrong."</p><p>-- The New Yorker</p>Charles Willeford was a highly decorated (Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Luxembourg Croix de Guerre) tank commander with the Third Army in World War II.

Succinct, lucidly argued, and lively in its detail, this book offers a brilliant summation of the life&#39;s work of a master historian.</p><p>Richard Pipes conducts a succinct inquest, asking: Why did tsarism fall virtually overnight? Why did the Bolsheviks - the smallest of the three main Russian radical parties - triumph? Why did Stalin succeed Lenin? In answering these questions, Pipes gives us our clearest picture yet of the vulnerability of the tsarist system as well as of the ruthless opportunism that enabled Lenin to seize the reins of power. Dispelling years of revisionist mythology, Pipes demonstrates the extent to which Stalin was the logical heir to a party that had assumed control over every aspect of Russian life.<b>Richard Pipes&nbsp;</b>was for many years a professor of history at Harvard University. He is the author of numerous books and essays on Russia, past and present, including&nbsp;<i>Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime</i>. In 1981&#x2013;82 he served as President Reagan's National Security Council adviser on Soviet and East European affairs, and he has twice received a Guggenheim fellowship.&nbsp;He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Marlborough, New Hampshire.</p><h2>God&#x2019;s War: A New History of the Crusades</h2><p><p><i>God's War</i> offers a sweeping new vision of one of history's most astounding events: the Crusades. </p><p>From 1096 to 1500, European Christians fought to recreate the Middle East, Muslim Spain, and the pagan Baltic in the image of their God. The Crusades are perhaps both the most familiar and most misunderstood phenomena of the medieval world, and here Christopher Tyerman seeks to recreate, from the ground up, the centuries of violence committed as an act of religious devotion. </p><p>The result is a stunning reinterpretation of the Crusades, revealed as both bloody political acts and a manifestation of a growing Christian communal identity. Tyerman uncovers a system of belief bound by aggression, paranoia, and wishful thinking, and a culture founded on war as an expression of worship, social discipline, and Christian charity. </p><p>This astonishing historical narrative is imbued with figures that have become legends--Saladin, Richard the Lionheart, Philip Augustus. But Tyerman also delves beyond these leaders to examine the thousands and thousands of Christian men--from Knights Templars to mercenaries to peasants--who, in the name of their Savior, abandoned their homes to conquer distant and alien lands, as well as the countless people who defended their soil and eventually turned these invaders back. With bold analysis, Tyerman explicates the contradictory mix of genuine piety, military ferocity, and plain greed that motivated generations of Crusaders. He also offers unique insight into the maturation of a militant Christianity that defined Europe's identity and that has forever influenced the cyclical antagonisms between the Christian and Muslim worlds. </p><p>Drawing on all of the most recent scholarship, and told with great verve and authority, <i>God's War</i> is the definitive account of a fascinating and horrifying story that continues to haunt our contemporary world.</p></p><p>Christopher Tyerman is Lecturer in Medieval History at Hertford College and New College, University of Oxford.&#x201c;Christopher Tyerman has crafted a superb book whose majestic architecture compares with Runciman's classic study of the Crusades...He is an entertaining as well as reliable guide to the bizarre centuries-long episode in which Western Christianity willfully ignored its Master's principles of love and forgiveness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Diarmaid MacCulloch, author of <i>Thomas Cranmer: a Life</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a magisterial work. In <i>God's War</i>, the Crusades are not just emblematic episodes in a troubled history of Europe's encounter with Islam. Tyerman shows that they are, with all their contradictions&#x2015;tragedy and tomfoolery, idealism and cynicism, piety and savagery&#x2015;fundamentally and inescapably human.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul M. Cobb, Associate Professor of Islamic History, Fellow of the Medieval Institute, University of Notre Dame</b><br><br>&#x201c;Tyerman's wonderful book is contemporary medieval history-writing at the top of its game. It is also the finest history of the Crusades that anyone has ever written, fully informed by its predecessors and by the excellent scholarship of the past half century. Trenchantly written on the grand scale and full of vivid detail, clear argument, and sharp judgment, <i>God's War</i> shows how the entire apparatus of crusade became tightly woven into European institutional and social life and consciousness, offering a highly original perspective on all of early European history and on European relations with non-Europeans. It shows no patience with ignorant mythologizing, modern condescension, or cultural instrumentalism.. In short, it constitutes a crusade history for the twenty-first century&#x2015;and just in time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Edward M. Peters, Henry Charles Lea Professor of History, University of Pennsylvania</b><br><br>&#x201c;At a time when interest in the Middle East and the Crusades has reached a new height, Christopher Tyerman has made a significant contribution to the ever-growing shelves of books devoted to this subject. Tyerman's well-written book focuses heavily on the development of ideas about holy war from antiquity onward and on the crusade to the East from the eleventh to the sixteenth century. It is based on a careful reading of both primary and secondary sources and will prove an important resource for a broad audience of scholars, students, and general readers. The comparison with Runciman's history leaps out from the pages of this large volume and the temptation to address it will no doubt seduce others, but this volume is Tyerman through and through.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James M. Powell, Professor Emeritus of Medieval History, Syracuse University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is likely to replace Steven Runciman's 50-year-old <i>History of the Crusades</i> as the standard work. Tyerman, lecturer in medieval history at Oxford University, demolishes our simplistic misconceptions about that series of ferocious campaigns in the Middle East, Muslim Spain and the pagan Baltic between 1096 and 1500...<i>God's War</i> is that very rare thing: a readable and vivid history written with the support of a formidable scholarly background, and it deserves to reach a wide audience.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly (starred review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Challenging traditional conceptions of the Crusades, e.g., the failure to retain Jerusalem, Tyerman believes that it was the weakening of papal power and the rise of secular governments in Europe that finally doomed the crusading impulse. This is a marvelously conceived, written, and supported book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert J.

She knew it, though there was no particular reason to think today would be different. The sun wasn&#x2019;t shining. The sun was barely even up, but it didn&#x2019;t matter much. The universe was speaking to Juniper directly, lighting a fire in her veins and making her heartbeat thrum. It whispered to her in a soft, lilting voice:<br> <br>Today is the day your life is going to change.<br> <br>She sat up in bed. Kicking away her tangled sheets (and running a hand through her equally tangled hair), she crawled to the window, looking down. And there she was. The blond, bedraggled mailwoman was leaning over the mailbox, stuffing a host of envelopes inside. Juniper couldn&#x2019;t tell for certain, but she had a sneaking suspicion the envelope was among them.<br> <br>She raced from her room. Down the hallway she went, past her baby sister&#x2019;s nursery, and the bedroom where her parents slept, their limbs entwined like the branches of neighboring trees. Soon the family would wake, and she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to scour the mailbox in secret. But if she was very quiet (avoiding this floorboard, and that creaky step), she could slip outside without anyone noticing.<br> <br>So she did. Out of the olive Victorian she went, into the white, winter world. Overnight, the yard had been transformed. Icicles dangled from the oaks, threatening to impale Juniper as she passed beneath them. And at the end of the yard, the snow-frosted mailbox stood out like a sore thumb.<br> <br>Juniper yanked it open. Her fingers danced over advertisements, brushing the edges of a coupon packet, and then she was pulling the envelope out of the darkness. She knew it was the envelope she&#x2019;d been waiting for, even before she saw it. It was big, and it was fat, and the writing was . . .<br> <br>Blood red? The envelope leapt from her hand. It fluttered slowly, like the snowflakes falling around her, and by the time it hit the ground, she&#x2019;d registered two things: This was not the letter she&#x2019;d been waiting for. It was an invitation.<br> <br>She scooped it out of the snow. Someone had written, You are cordially invited to a night of murder and mayhem! on the back of the ebony envelope, and Juniper turned it over, confirming that it was addressed to her. It was. Thanks but no thanks, she thought, ripping it in half. She had zero interest in getting wasted with her classmates, and even less interest in pretending death was hilarious. The only reason she was stalking her mailbox was because she was expecting an acceptance letter from Columbia University. Their online system was down, which meant she&#x2019;d be getting her news the old-fashioned way.<br> <br>And so it went. Juniper raced to the mailbox on Monday morning, then Tuesday. By Wednesday, her confidence had started to ebb. Why was she so convinced she&#x2019;d be getting an acceptance letter? Yes, her grades were mostly stellar, but last winter, after that party up in the hills . . .<br> <br>Juniper shook herself. She&#x2019;d only fallen off track for a month, and most of her teachers had let her make up the work. Even if she didn&#x2019;t get into the college of her choice, she had a couple of safety schools that would take her far away from this town. She&#x2019;d still go to med school. Cure people. Save lives. Everything would go according to plan.<br> <br>She was about to return to the house when a black envelope caught her eye, way back in the corner of the mailbox. A shiver skittered up her spine. She already knew what the envelope was. An invitation to &#x201c;a night of murder and mayhem!&#x201d;<br> <br>They&#x2019;d probably mailed two by mistake, she thought, rolling her eyes. But as she drew the envelope from the darkness, an undertow of guilt started tugging at her limbs. This was how it always happened. She&#x2019;d be going about her day, not even thinking about Dahlia Kane&#x2019;s Christmas party, and out of nowhere, her limbs would get heavy. She&#x2019;d feel herself sinking, the way a body sinks to the bottom of a swimming pool, while people stand by, laughing&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Junebug!&#x201d; Mrs. Torres appeared in the doorway, her face flushed from standing over the stove. &#x201c;Breakfast, mi amor. What is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Crap. Juniper&#x2019;s reflexes were dulled this early in the morning. Two hours (and three cups of coffee) from now, she&#x2019;d never have let her mother see this envelope. But now she was trapped, and she couldn&#x2019;t very well shred the thing in front of her mom. She&#x2019;d have to play this just right.<br> <br>Forcing a smile, she jogged up to the doorway. &#x201c;Just some dork&#x2019;s idea of a good time,&#x201d; she said, holding up the invitation. She wasn&#x2019;t offering it to her mother; she had a very good grip on the envelope. But Mrs. Torres must&#x2019;ve seen a night of murder and mayhem! scrawled across the back, because she snatched it out of her daughter&#x2019;s hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ooh, a party. You should go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? No.&#x201d; Juniper scrunched up her face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably on Saturday. I&#x2019;m watching Rudolph with Olive.&#x201d; Olive was her baby sister, and now that the kid could walk, Juniper was pretty much on permanent call. She chose to think of it as practice for when she was actually on call at the hospital of her choice. Better get used to functioning on two hours of sleep, right?<br> <br>&#x201c;Junebug, she&#x2019;s my kid.&#x201d; Her mother disappeared into the hallway, and Juniper followed close behind, plotting to retrieve the invitation. &#x201c;Believe it or not, I like spending time with my kids.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And yet, you&#x2019;re forcing me out of the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just making a suggestion.&#x201d; Her mother pulled out a chair at the kitchen table. Olive was in her high chair, giggling and dancing in that I-can-see-invisible-fairies way that babies had. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to have fun with your friends?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They aren&#x2019;t my friends. They probably sent one to every senior at school.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All the more reason to go,&#x201d; her mother said, swooping in with the old, chipped coffeepot. &#x201c;Just think about it, okay? It wouldn&#x2019;t kill you to go to a party.&#x201d;<br> <br>It might, Juniper thought, her hands starting to shake. She took a gulp of coffee, hoping her mother wouldn&#x2019;t notice her jumpiness. Luckily, Mrs. Torres was busy fussing with the tostadas on the stove. But somebody did notice, and when coffee sloshed over Juniper&#x2019;s fingers, her baby sister frowned, reaching for their mother&#x2019;s purse. Two years old, and she&#x2019;d already decided makeup was the cure for sadness. Juniper wasn&#x2019;t sure where she&#x2019;d learned it. This wasn&#x2019;t exactly a beauty pageant house. But wherever the lesson had come from, Juniper didn&#x2019;t mind being her sister&#x2019;s living dolly. Olive&#x2019;s eyes got so bright and her mouth got so smiley.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tip-sick!&#x201d; the baby announced, pulling out a vibrant burgundy gloss that would make Juniper look like she&#x2019;d been eating berries. Or drinking wine. It was kind of pretty, and Juniper was okay with looking kind of pretty, as long as it didn&#x2019;t eclipse her other accomplishments. She felt a pang as Olive dabbed the gloss on her lips, wishing she could stay in town and teach her sister about making people better, rather than beautiful. But she couldn&#x2019;t stay after everything that had happened&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;and besides, nothing she could say to Olive would be as influential as becoming the doctor she&#x2019;d always wanted to be. She&#x2019;d do everything she&#x2019;d set out to do, and one day, she&#x2019;d whisk her family out of this creepy little town, away from all of its secrets.<br> <br>Its ghosts.<br> <br>After the lip gloss was on, Olive clapped her hands, squealing, &#x201c;Pretty!&#x201d; and Juniper felt the cracks in her heart close.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are, baby girl,&#x201d; she said, as tiny fingers encircled one of her own. Meanwhile, their mother had gone completely silent by the stove. Juniper turned, goose bumps rising on her arms, to find Mrs. Torres leaning against the counter, staring at a single page.<br> <br>&#x201c;What? Mama, what?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother didn&#x2019;t answer, so Juniper snatched up the invitation. She made no attempt to be sly about it. One second the paper was fluttering in her mother&#x2019;s fingers, and then it wasn&#x2019;t. One second the breath was filling Juniper&#x2019;s lungs, and then it was gone.<br> <br>Dear Miss Torres,<br> <br>Due to your achievements in ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE, you are cordially invited to a murder mystery dinner! Prepare to be challenged as you, and five of your esteemed classmates, fight to unravel the mystery and apprehend a killer!<br> <br>The world will become a stage!<br> <br>A friend will become a foe!<br> <br>Costumes will arrive later this week!<br> <br>And, of course, the winner will take home the coveted $50,000 Burning Embers Scholarship, to be used at the school of his or her choice.<br> <br>Your humble benefactor,<br> <br>The Ringmaster<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a scam.&#x201d; The words were out of Juniper&#x2019;s mouth before she could stop them, and even after she&#x2019;d spoken them, she felt no desire to take them back. Even after her mother sank into a chair, studying the invitation in shock.<br> <br>&#x201c;You were right, it is on Saturday,&#x201d; Mrs. Torres said. Her voice was breathy, and Juniper hated the thought of disappointing her. &#x201c;They must&#x2019;ve had a last-minute opening&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, it&#x2019;s a scam. Real scholarship offers don&#x2019;t sound like this.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d never even heard of the Burning Embers Scholarship. She&#x2019;d never heard of it, and she didn&#x2019;t like the sound of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t an offer,&#x201d; her mother said calmly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a contest.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Real scholarships don&#x2019;t make you compete,&#x201d; Juniper insisted. &#x201c;Not like this. Not at a murder mystery dinner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Misery dinner!&#x201d; Olive shouted, and Juniper cringed. She did not want her sister repeating that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Calm down, baby girl. Eat your Cheerios.&#x201d;<br> <br>But it was an exercise in futility. Juniper&#x2019;s own breakfast sat, forgotten, on the stove. Even her coffee cup couldn&#x2019;t entice her now. &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;ll do some research,&#x201d; she said, plucking her mother&#x2019;s phone from the table, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m pretty sure scholarship foundations don&#x2019;t sign their letters &#x2018;The Ringmaster.&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re trying to make it fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re trying to make money off me.&#x201d; She typed Burning Embers Scholarship into the search engine, waiting for zero hits to come up. &#x201c;Just wait. The day before the contest, I&#x2019;ll get a second letter, asking for an entry fee. If there isn&#x2019;t a website . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Juniper trailed off, clicking the first of several links. Not only did the Burning Embers Foundation have a website, it looked legit. There was an &#x201c;About&#x201d; page that highlighted the project&#x2019;s aims (finding unique and exciting ways to reward students who excel in academics, fine arts, and athletics) and a &#x201c;Contact&#x201d; page with a phone number, an email address, and a physical location. Juniper made a vow to contact them in every way possible before Saturday&#x2019;s event, to prove that real people worked at the foundation.<br> <br>Or rather, to prove that they didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>She wasn&#x2019;t certain why she was being contrary at this point. A fifty-thousand-dollar scholarship would change her life. Hadn&#x2019;t she spent the past six months applying to every scholarship she could find, hoping for one-fifth of that amount?<br> <br>&#x201c;I never applied for this,&#x201d; she mumbled, her last-ditch effort at logic. &#x201c;I would&#x2019;ve remembered&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sometimes teachers submit you. Guidance counselors. You&#x2019;re such a good student, and you were going to be valedictorian.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yes, I was going to be valedictorian. Then I went to a party, last December . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait, let me see that.&#x201d; She smoothed out the invitation on the table. It didn&#x2019;t take long to locate the date of the event: December 21. One year exactly since Dahlia Kane&#x2019;s Christmas party.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This money would be a big deal for us,&#x201d; her mother broke in softly. &#x201c;Your father could use the good news.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Juniper glanced at his empty chair. After fifteen years of teaching music at Fallen Oaks Elementary, a recent round of budget cuts had left Mr. Torres jobless. Now Juniper could hear him milling around upstairs, choosing the perfect tie for another set of dehumanizing interviews.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you going to tell him you&#x2019;re passing up fifty thousand dollars?&#x201d; Her mother fixed her with a stare. &#x201c;After everything he&#x2019;s been through?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d; Juniper swallowed, her chest tightening. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t understand who would submit me for this sort of thing. I&#x2019;m the world&#x2019;s worst actress.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe Ruby did it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Juniper blinked. She could see her mother staring at her, could see her baby sister bouncing in the periphery, but she felt completely displaced. Like she was floating outside of space and time.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying, she has quite the flair for the dramatic. This sort of thing is right up her alley,&#x201d; Mrs. Torres explained. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you give her a call and ask about it?&#x201d; Then, almost too quietly for Juniper to hear, she added, &#x201c;I miss that girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>I miss her too. Juniper&#x2019;s vision blurred as she thought of Ruby&#x2019;s smile, Ruby&#x2019;s laugh, Ruby&#x2019;s touch. She pushed off from the table, her chair screeching behind her. Too bad she doesn&#x2019;t miss me.<br> <br>+ + +<br> <br>Juniper slammed her bedroom door, leaning against it. She knew she was overreacting, but she didn&#x2019;t know how to stop it. It was like being in one of those dreams where you are yourself, and see yourself from outside your body. Like being God and Jesus at the same time.<br> <br>She shook her head, crossing the room. If she was any kind of religious, it was casually Catholic with atheistic leanings. She just wasn&#x2019;t sure she believed in anything anymore. Still, she&#x2019;d always been fascinated with the idea of being God and Jesus at the same time. Of being inside your body and watching from high above. Maybe that was what it meant to have a body and a soul, to be at one single point, and everywhere, all at once.<br> <br>Juniper dug her phone out of her purse. She told herself these thoughts were random, the musings of a girl who still desperately needed her morning caffeine, but deep down, she knew the truth. After everything she&#x2019;d done to Ruby, she wanted to believe in the possibility of redemption.<br> <br>She wanted to believe she had a soul.<br> <br>With trembling hands, she typed out the message, Did you submit me for the Burning Embers Scholarship? Ruby&#x2019;s number was still in her phone. She couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to erase it, which was definitely ironic, considering the thing she&#x2019;d erased from Ruby&#x2019;s life.<br> <br>The person.<br> <br>She hit send, then dropped the phone onto her bed. She absolutely would not wait by the phone like a sad little girl on prom night, hoping and hoping while her heart sank to her knees. But maybe Ruby had been waiting for her. The phone pinged almost instantly, and she found herself scrabbling to pluck it from the bed, her eyes scanning the message frantically: No.<br> <br>Juniper started to laugh. It was the cold, brittle kind of laughter, like twigs snapping underfoot. Of course Ruby hadn&#x2019;t submitted her for the scholarship. Of course Ruby wasn&#x2019;t looking out for her from behind the scenes. Their friendship was over. It had been over for a long time.<br> <br>She sank down to her bed. When her phone lit up again, she was surprised to feel her heart leap. How could she still have hope after everything that had happened? Her heart was a bruised and bludgeoned thing. A Pandora&#x2019;s box filled with grief and regret. But somewhere, hidden in the darkness, hope was glittering. It caused her breath to falter as she read Ruby&#x2019;s text.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t submit you, Ruby wrote, but I&#x2019;m going to the party. Maybe we can solve the mystery together?<br> <br>Juniper didn&#x2019;t trust herself with w...</p><h2>The Secret Lives of Hoarders: True Stories of Tackling Extreme Clutter</h2><p>On the front lines with extreme hoarders <br><br> <i>The Secret Lives of Hoarders</i> is much more than harrowing tales of attacking the ugliest, dirtiest, and most shocking hoarding cases in the country.

Most important, he guides compulsive hoarders successfully through every step of the clean-up and healing process. <br><br> <i>The Secret Lives of Hoarders</i> is an engrossing and sometimes unsettling look at extreme clutter but one that helps hoarders, their families, and their friends to find meaning in the chaos.</p><p>The idea for Clutter Cleaner came to <b>Matt Paxton</b>&nbsp;as a way to pay rent, with the first project being his own grandmother's basement.

Spurgeon wants readers only to consume his work and ponder it, he asks nothing in return because he believes in the power of God to bring unbelievers to Him. This classic text brought into contemporary English is both a perfect introduction to salvation and an assurance of it for unbelievers and the saved alike. In the last line, Spurgeon beseeches readers to accept salvation now and "Meet me in heaven."&nbsp;The Read &amp; Reflect with the Classics edition of <i>All of Grace </i>includes the classic text in an easy to read adaption coupled with personal reflection questions, additional study questions, and prayer prompts for today's Christian reader.</p><p>In All of Grace, C.H. Spurgeon outlines the plan of salvation in such clear, simple language that everyone can understand and be drawn to the Father. Any attempt to please God based upon our own works brings self&#x2013;righteousness and coldness of heart. It is the free grace and mercy of God that makes the heart glow with warmth and thankfulness for God's love.<br> <br> The heartfelt goal of this dynamic classic is summed up in Spurgeon's final cry to the reader, "Meet me in heaven!!"<br> <br> "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." &#x2013;&#x2013; Revelation 22:17<br>By the age of twenty-one <b>C.H.

He was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America.&nbsp; His work ranges from the searing noir investigations of alcoholic detective Matt Scudder to the witty adventures of master burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr and includes many stunning stand-alone thrillers.Before Matt Scudder, before Bernie Rhodenbarr, before being named a Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, Lawrence Block turned out paperback originals. This one--unavailable for more than 40 years--now receives a timely reissue from Hard Case Crime. It's a doozy. Bill Maynard is a card mechanic (cheater) who took a beating in Chicago and now is in serious need of some dental work. He finds it in an unnamed burg on the road to New York, and he also finds a nice little poker game. But who wanders into the game but one of the player's wives--who just happens to know a mechanic when she sees one. Soon enough Maynard and the wife are plotting to skip town with the husband's money, but, of course, the plan goes awry--in part because the square's life starts to feel good to our card shark. Block unwinds his plot superbly, pointing toward a classic noir finale but then seeming to pull away--or maybe not. And, along the way, there is all the teasing sexuality and tongue-in-cheek noir style that a pulp devotee craves. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is the first graphic novel to win a major British literary prize.</p><p>This first book from Chicago author Chris Ware is a pleasantly-decorated view at a lonely and emotionally-impaired &#34;everyman&#34; (Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth), who is provided, at age 36, the opportunity to meet his father for the first time. An improvisatory romance which gingerly deports itself between 1890&#39;s Chicago and 1980&#39;s small town Michigan, the reader is helped along by thousands of colored illustrations and diagrams, which, when read rapidly in sequence, provide a convincing illusion of life and movement. The bulk of the work is supported by fold-out instructions, an index, paper cut-outs, and a brief apology, all of which concrete to form a rich portrait of a man stunted by a paralyzing fear of being disliked.Chris Ware lives in Oak Park, Illinois, and is the author of Jimmy Corrigan - the Smartest Kid on Earth. He is currently serializing two new graphic novels in his ongoing periodical The ACME Novelty Library, the 20th issue of which will be released in fall 2010.

From the broad, interdisciplinary perspective that marks Fromm's distinguished oeuvre, he shows that psychology cannot divorce itself from the problems of philosophy and ethics, and that human nature cannot be understood without understanding the values and moral conflicts that confront us all.

Writing from decades of counseling and personal ministry experience, Ajith Fernando points Christian leaders back to the most important aspect of their lives: their relationship with God. He then offers practical guidance for responding to real-life situations in the home, including disciplining children, dealing with disappointment, loving one&#x2019;s spouse, and pursuing joy.

It advances peacebuilding as a needed challenge to and expansion of the traditional framework of just-war theory and pacifism. It builds on a critical reading of historical landmarks from the Bible through Augustine, Aquinas, the Reformers, Christian peace movements, and key modern figures like Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Reinhold Niebuhr, and recent popes. Similar to just-war theory, peacebuilding is committed to social change and social justice but includes some theorists and practitioners who accept the use of force in extreme cases of self-defense or humanitarian intervention. Unlike just-war theorists, they do not see the justification of war as part of the Christian mission. Unlike traditional pacifists, they do see social change as necessary and possible and, as such, requiring Christian participation in public efforts.</p><p>Cahill argues that transformative Christian social participation is demanded by the gospel and the example of Jesus, and can produce the avoidance, resolution, or reduction of conflicts. And yet obstacles are significant, and expectations must be realistic. Decisions to use armed force against injustice, even when they meet the criteria of just war, will be ambiguous and tragic from a Christian perspective. Regarding war and peace, the focus of Christian theology, ethics, and practice should not be on justifying war but on practical and hopeful interreligious peacebuilding.</p></p><p><p><b>Lisa Sowle Cahill</b> is J.

In the process, he pitches estrangement against communion, examines the past as history versus the past as memory, and reflects on the past&#x2019;s capacity both to teach and to mislead us&#x2015;also to make us hesitate in the face of love, given the loss and damage that are, often enough, love&#x2019;s fallout. How &#x201c;to say no to despair&#x201d;? How to take perhaps that greatest risk, the risk of believing in what offers no guarantee? These poems that, in their wedding of the philosophical, meditative, and lyric modes, mark a new stage in Phillips&#x2019;s remarkable work, stand as further proof that &#x201c;if Carl Phillips had not come onto the scene, we would have needed to invent him.

But her greatest joy is to visit the sea, where whales gather every morning to gaily spout rainbows.<br><br> Then, one day, she finds a man in the mist where a whale should be: Reu, who has taken human form out of his Great Love for her. Together these first humans become parents to two whales, and then to mankind. Even after Reu dies, Nau continues on, sharing her story of brotherhood between the two species. But as these origins grow more distant, the old woman&#x2019;s tales are subsumed into myth&#x2015;and her descendants turn increasingly bent on parading their dominance over the natural world.<br><br> Buoyantly translated into English for the first time by Ilona Yazhbin Chavasse, this new entry in the Seedbank series is at once a vibrant retelling of the origin story of the Chukchi, a timely parable about the destructive power of human ego&#x2015;and another unforgettable work of fiction from Yuri Rytkheu, &#x201c;arguably the foremost writer to emerge from the minority peoples of Russia&#x2019;s far north&#x201d; (<i>New York Review of Books</i>).</p><p><b>Yuri Rytkheu</b> (1930&#x2013;2008) was born in Uelen, a village in the Chukotka region of Siberia.

The English translation of his book <i>A Dream in Polar Fog</i> was a Kiriyama Pacific Rim Prize Notable Book in 2006. In the late 1950s, Rytkheu emerged not only as a great literary talent, but as the unique voice of a small national minority&#x2015;the Chukchi people, a shrinking community residing in one of the most majestic and inhospitable environments on earth.<br><br> <b>Ilona Yazhbin Chavasse</b> was born in Belarus and, together with her family, emigrated to the United States in 1989.

Sheen</h2><p>Divided into three sections (Mind, Heart, and Spirit), these special texts are a testament to Sheen&#39;s own tenacity, which won him a loyal worldwide following.</p><p>Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen (1895-1979), one of the 20th century&#39;s best-known and loved Catholic prelates, was a lecturer, professor, philosopher, preacher, and writer. A radio and television personality, he is widely regarded as the original media luminary for the spiritual world. This former director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith leaves behind an enormous written and oral history. In addition to two weekly syndicated newspaper columns that ran for close to two decades, he authored scores of books.This devotional collection, published to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Archbishop Sheen's birth, draws on material published over a 60-year span, from 1929 to 1989 (10 years after Sheen's death). Not surprisingly, the subject matter is varied, but much of it retains a surprisingly contemporary ring. The selections are short, practical, and down to earth. They give ample evidence of the style that made Sheen one of the first popular radio and television preachers as well as a best-selling author. The collection will certainly appeal to those who remember him and were part of his audience. It may serve the publisher's purpose of introducing Sheen to a new generation. It will, in any case, serve as a fitting centennial celebration of one of the most important shapers of popular religious thought in the twentieth century. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>Thomas Kinkade&#39;s Cape Light: When Christmas Comes (A Cape Light Novel)</h2><p><b><i>Christmas brings big changes to the Inn on Angel Island...and for the Warwick family in Cape Light, secrets long hidden must be revealed. </i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Liza Merritt is grateful for the many blessings in her life when she returns to Angel Island with her family to celebrate Thanksgiving.

Her brief book engenders confidence and caring in the initiate, and assuages the fear and anxiety that naturally occur when one accompanies people in life-changing pain and travail.

Typically, they start strong and experience periods of growth, then stagnate and lose members. Since 1991, the North American population has increased by 15 percent while the number of "unchurched" people has increased by 92 percent. Large church houses that were filled in the 1950s and `60s now hold a fraction of their capacity. <p>To counter this trend, authors Ed Stetzer and Mike Dodson surveyed 300 churches from across ten different denominations that recently achieved healthy evangelistic growth after a significant season of decline.

Founded with the mission of creating rounded, complete people by balancing the arts and manual labor within a democratic, nonhierarchical structure, Black Mountain was a crucible of revolutionary literature.

For Ryan is being stalked by a mysterious woman who feels entitled to everything he has. She&#x2019;s the spitting image of the twenty-six-year-old donor of the heart beating steadily in Ryan&#x2019;s own chest.</p> <p>And she&#x2019;s come to take it back.</p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive Essay: Dean Koontz on Writing <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i></strong> <br> <p>I have been asked by the secret masters of Amazon how much research into transplant surgery I did before writing <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i>. I would like to reveal that, in the interest of accuracy and the accumulation of vivid detail, and because I bring total commitment to my writing, I underwent a heart transplant myself, even though I didn't need one. This would be a lie, however, and people without a sense of humor would write by the hundreds to accuse me of taking a perfectly good heart needed by some patient who <i>really</i> needed it.</p> <p>To prepare for this novel, I read a few books on the subject of transplants, watched two educational films during which I passed out repeatedly at the sight of blood, and spoke with a few medical specialists in the field--largely to ascertain how they manage not to pass out in surgery every time they expose the pulsing internal organs of a patient.</p> <p>Ryan Perry, the lead of <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i>, is 34, wealthy from the Internet social-networking site that he created, with an ideal life ahead of him. Then he learns he suffers from cardiomyopathy and will die within a year if he does not undergo a heart transplant. The procedure is successful, but a year later he begins to receive gifts--such as a heart-shaped locket--with the message "Your heart belongs to me. I want it back."</p> <p>Although it might seem to be a ghost story, <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i> is something else entirely. In addition to being a thriller with a medical procedure as a key element, it is an unusual love story. Those who have never read my books--we know who you are--might be surprised to learn that more often than not, a love story is part of the mix. In a romantic relationship, we're vulnerable; and when a character in a novel is vulnerable, we are more likely to worry about him or her and to relate more intimately to the story. Furthermore, people in love have something precious to lose, and in their sometimes desperate efforts to hold fast to that love, they reveal themselves more profoundly than they might otherwise.</p> <p>In the early years of my career--or what we here in Koontzland call "the long slog"--publishers resisted me when I wanted to mix genres. These days, my publisher encourages me to pursue fresh ways of telling stories. Consequently, <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i> is a suspense novel and love story with a thread of the supernatural weaving through it, set against a backdrop of medicine and medical mystery, concerning certain issues of ethics that are timeless--and others that are unique to our time. And I promise you that the medical detail is not so graphic that you will pass out.</p> <br> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Dean Koontz</strong> <br> <p><b>Q: <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i> is very suspenseful but at the same time an affecting love story. How difficult was this to pull off?</b> <br> A: Well, life is full of suspense and, if we're lucky, it's full of love as well. From minute to minute and day to day, we never know what will happen to us, good or bad, so suspense is the fundamental condition of existence. That doesn't change when we fall in love or when we love a child or a sibling or a great dog. In fact, the more we love, the more we have to lose, which puts a sharper edge on the suspense in life and in <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i>. Ryan Perry, the lead of the story, enjoys self-made wealth and good health and the love of a good woman--so when all that starts to slip away from him, it's actually easier for me to move readers to the edge of their seats and keep them there. </p> <p><b>Q: Your books are full of details about how things work in the real world--like life in a monastery in <i>Brother Odd</i>, the management of a great Bel Air estate and the intricacies of police work in <i>The Face</i>, <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i> is rich with details about medical conditions and heart transplants. Since you don't specialize in one kind of novel, how do you learn about all these different things? Do you engage in a lot of Internet research?</b> <br> A: I never go on-line. My writing schedule and other obligations keep me busy 18/7. The other six hours, I sleep. I know that I am a potentially obsessive personality and that it's easy to become obsessed with one aspect or another of the Internet, until hours a day are consumed by it. Therefore, I stay away. I do most of my research from books and publications, and by conducting interviews with specialists in whatever fields my story will touch upon. One of my assistants is on-line, and in a pinch, if I can't turn up a fact I need, she can get it for me. As a high-school and college student, I hated research and libraries. I always shamelessly made up the facts in reports that I wrote, and cited nonexistent books by nonexistent writers in my footnotes. And I always got away with it! But as a novelist, I've been surprised to find that I greatly enjoy doing research. I think the difference is--in school, they told me what I had to learn, and I bristled at authority; when I chose the subject, I proved to be an industrious autodidact. </p> <p><b>Q: Your hero in <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i>, Ryan Perry, is different from your other heroes, like Odd Thomas and Mitchell Rafferty and Tim Carrier. What was it about the story you were telling in <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i> that required this change?</b> <br> A: Most of my heroes come from ordinary occupations--a fry cook, a baker, a mason, a gardener, a bartender--which makes them like many of my friends in real life. But Ryan Perry in <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i> has made a couple hundred million from an Internet business. For this story, I needed a hero who, at the opening, has everything: he's wealthy, he has a beautiful girlfriend whom he loves and who loves him, he essentially leads a life of leisure at 34, he's vigorous and handsome and charming.... And then everything that really matters begins to slip away from him. He had to be at the top in order to be at risk of a long fall. As he begins to think that some people in his life are involved in a conspiracy to kill him, he needed to be a man of exceptional resources to pursue that investigation.</p> <p><b>Q: Where did the idea for <i>Your Heart Belongs to Me</i> come from?</b> <br> A: I was on the phone with a friend, talking about a smorgasbord of things, when the subject of heart transplants came up, and he told me something, an anecdote, that astonished me. Before I hung up, I had spun that small fact into a story that I couldn't wait to write. I've already made it clear to him that he gets no royalties! Story ideas have come to me from lines in songs, from a scrap of overheard conversation, from just about everywhere. And sometimes a story pops into my head, and I have no idea what the source of it was. Thank God this keeps happening; otherwise I might have to learn an honest trade like plumbing.</p> <p><b>Q: What is next for you? Another Odd Thomas novel?</b> <br> A: There will be three more Odd Thomas novels, but my book for spring 2009 is not one of them. It's titled <i>The Other Side of the Woods</i> and is in the vein of <i>Life Expectancy</i>. I'm having great fun with it. Even when writing is hard, I always have fun with it. In fact, the harder it is, the more fun it is, because the challenge is what makes the work worthwhile.</p><b>Dean Koontz,</b> the author of many #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, lives in Southern California with his wife, Gerda, their golden retriever, Elsa, and the enduring spirit of their goldens, Trixie and Anna.</p><h2>The Turn-Around, Upside-Down Alphabet Book (ALA Notable Children&#39;s Books.

Each page contains a large block letter enclosed in a square that, when viewed from a different direction&#x2013;left, right, or upside-down (hence the title)&#x2013;transforms into an entirely different object. For example, when "J" is rotated clockwise, it becomes, in turn, "an elephant's trunk," "a candy cane," and "a monkey's tail." Some designs, like "O," are easy to spot (bagel, owl's eye, fried egg); others, like "K" (picnic table, a mama duck with two ducklings, Martian's antennae) and "W" (two fish, a cat casting a shadow, a mountain stream), present more of a challenge. With touches of humor and a great deal of creativity, Ernst fashioned this book out of cut paper and surrounded each block with a thick black border that sets off white words. Children will enjoy tilting the pages to see the transformations and will be motivated to come up with ideas of their own.<i>&#x2013;Laurie Edwards, West Shore School District, Camp Hill, PA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Beginning his story in the latter half of the seventeenth century, while also looking back to the Renaissance and forward to the future, Hazard traces the process by which new developments<br>in the sciences, arts, philosophy, and philology came to undermine the stable foundations of the classical world, with its commitment to tradition, stability, proportion, and settled usage. Hazard shows how travelers&#x2019; tales and archaeological investigation widened European awareness and acceptance of cultural difference; how the radical rationalism of Spinoza and Richard Simon&#x2019;s new historical exegesis of the Bible called into question the revealed truths of religion; how the Huguenot Pierre Bayle&#x2019;s critical dictionary of ideas paved the way for Voltaire and the Enlightenment, even as the empiricism of Locke encouraged a new attention to sensory experience that led to Rousseau and romanticism. Hazard&#x2019;s range of knowledge is vast, and whether the subject is operas, excavations, or scientific experiments his brilliant style and powers of description bring to life the thinkers who thought up the modern world.</p><p>Paul Hazard (1878&#x2013;1944) was an eminent French historian of ideas and a pioneering scholar of comparative literature. After teaching at the University of Lyon and the Sorbonne, he was appointed to the chair of comparative literature at the Coll�ge de France in 1925 and in 1940 was elected to the French Academy. From 1932 on Hazard also taught at regular intervals at Columbia University, and he was in New York when the Nazis occupied France in 1941. He immediately returned to France to assume the rectorship of the University of Paris but was rejected for the position by the Nazis. Hazard&#x2019;s reputation rests on two major works of intellectual history: <i>The Crisis of the European Mind</i>, from 1935, and its sequel, <i>European Thought in the Eighteenth Century: From Montesquieu to Lessing</i>, published posthumously in 1946.<br><br>James Lewis May (b. 1873) was a British critic and translator, best known as a translator and biographer of Anatole France. His 1928 translation of <i>Madame Bovary</i> for The Bodley Head<br>was for many years the standard edition. In addition to translating <i>The Crisis of the European Mind</i>, May translated its sequel, <i>European Thought in the Eighteenth Century</i>.<br><br>Anthony Grafton is Henry Putnam University Professor of History and the Humanities at Princeton University. His most recent book is <i>The Culture of Correction in Renaissance<br>Europe</i>.Chapter I<br>The Ferment Begins<br>To preserve existing conditions, to keep things firm and<br>steady, to avoid any change that might disturb an equilibrium so miraculously attained - such was the paramount preoccupation of the Classical Age. There was peril in those questionings that vex the restless spirit. And not only peril, but folly to boot. For let a man rush off to the utmost limits of the globe, what will he find there but what he brings, that is to say, himself? And even if he found anything else,<br>would he not have wasted his mental and spiritual riches in the effort?<br>Far better that he should concentrate his powers, and focus them on those eternal questions which are certainly not to be solved by aimlessly flitting about from place to place. Seneca has it that the hall-mark of a well-regulated mind is<br>that it can call a halt when it will, and dwell at peace<br>within itself; while Pascal lays it down that all the ills that<br>afflict a man proceed from one sole cause, namely, that he has not learnt to sit quietly and contentedly in a room.<br>The classical mind, with the consciousness of its strength, loves stability, <br>nay, if it could, it would <i>be</i> stability. Now<br>that the Renaissance and the Reformation - big adventures these! - were<br>over, the time had come for a mental stock-taking, for an intellectual<br>'retreat'. Politics, religion, society, art &#x2013; all had been<br>rescued from the clutches of the ravening<br>critics. Humanity&#x2019;s storm-tossed barque had made port at last.<br>Long might it stay there? Long! Nay, let it stay there for ever! <br>Life was now a regular, well-ordered affair. Why, then, go outside this<br>happy pale, to risk encounters that<br>might unsettle everything? The Great Beyond was viewed with apprehension; it might contain some uncomfortable surprises. Nay, Time itself they would have made stand still, could they have stayed its flight. At Versailles, the visitor got the impression that the very waters had been<br>arrested in their course, caught and controlled as they were,<br>and sent skywards again, and yet again, as though destined<br>to do duty forever.<br>In Part II of Don Quixote, Cervantes presents to us a<br>gentleman in a green cloth riding-coat whom the Knight of<br>the Rueful Countenance encounters on the road. The gentleman<br>in question is making his way towards home, where<br>comfort and good cheer, on a modest scale, await him. He is<br>of some estate, though possessed of no great wealth. He<br>spends his time with his wife, his children, and his friends.<br>His favourite diversions are shooting and fishing, but he<br>keeps neither hawks nor greyhounds, only some decoy<br>partridges and a stout ferret. His library consists of some<br>six dozen books, which are sufficient for his needs. Sometimes<br>he dines with his neighbours and friends, and often<br>invites them in return. His table is neat and clean, and not<br>parsimoniously furnished. He likes freedom within limits,<br>and just-dealing, and good fellowship. He shares his substance<br>with the poor, making no parade of his good works.<br>He always endeavours to make peace between those that are<br>at variance. He is devoted to Our Lady, and ever trusts in<br>the infinite mercy of God. Such is how he portrays himself,<br>and Sancho whose feelings completely carry him away,<br>leaps off his ass and falls to covering the gentleman&#x2019;s feet<br>with kisses. 'What mean you by this, brother?&#x2019; said the<br>gendeman; 'why these embraces?' 'Suffer me to kiss your<br>feet' cries Sancho, 'for verily your worship is the first saint<br>on horseback I ever saw in all my life.'<br>Don Diego de Miranda, he of the green cloth riding-coat,<br>was not a saint. He was merely a preliminary adumbration,<br>dating back to 1615, of the classical ideal of wisdom and<br>moderation. He does not despise the Knight Errant; indeed,<br>he has a secret admiration for heroes and deeds of derring-do,<br>but he draws the line at taking the road himself. He<br>knows that a man is never so happy as when his mind, his<br>senses, and his heart are all working harmoniously together;<br>and having discovered that recipe for a contented life, he<br>clings to it, and will do so till his dying day.<br>But times change, and fashions with them. That precious<br>recipe of his won't count for much with the next generation,<br>and, when his grandsons arrive at man's estate, they<br>will regard the Knight of the Green Coat as a very out-of-date<br>old gentleman indeed. They will despise his placid,<br>contented outlook on life. No more, for them, of that spell<br>of calm, when a man might go about his lawful occasions<br>with a tranquil mind. Giving vent at last to his desires so<br>long repressed, off they will hie them, up and down the<br>world, looking for trouble. If, as time goes on, we see the<br>itch for travel wax stronger, more widespread; if, quitting<br>village, or town, or mother-land, explorers sally forth to<br>learn how others live and have their being, we must recognize<br>in this the first, faint hint of a change already brewing,<br>a change that, later on, will transform the whole complexion<br>of society.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Boileau was at Bourbon taking the waters, he felt<br>as if he was at the other end of the earth; Auteuil was world<br>enough for him. So was Paris, for Racine; and both of them,<br>Racine and Boileau, were terribly put about when they had<br>to accompany the King on one of his expeditions. Bossuet<br>never went to Rome; nor did F�nelon. Nor did Moli�re ever<br>revisit that barber's shop at P�zenas. The great classics were<br>not given to moving about; for the wanderers, we must wait<br>for Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau. But, in between, some<br>obscure forces had been at work, preparing the way for the<br>impending change.<br>The fact is that by the end of the seventeenth century<br>and the beginning of the eighteenth the Italians had revived<br>their taste for travel; and that the French were as<br>mobile as quicksilver. If a contemporary observer speaks the<br>truth about them, they were so enamoured of novelty that<br>they even took care not to keep a friend too long. According<br>to the same authority, they brought out some new fashion<br>every day, and finding nothing but drabness and boredom<br>at home, packed up their traps and set out for Asia, or it<br>might be Africa, to get a little change of scene, and something<br>to break the monotony. The Germans travelled as a<br>matter of habit; indeed the thing was in their blood; it was<br>a sort of mania with them. There was no keeping them at<br>home. 'We are born travellers, every mother's son of us,<br>like our fathers before us, and nothing, no business, however<br>urgent, ever keeps us back.' So say~sthe German that<br>Saint-Evremond brings on in that amusing comedy of his,<br><i>Sir Politick Would-be</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>As soon as we have got hold of a bit of Latin, we prepare to<br>start on our travels. The first thing we do is to procure an Itinerary,<br>showing the various routes we have to take; next, a handbook<br>mentioning all the things that ought to be seen in the<br>different countries. When our travellers are of a literary turn of<br>mind, they invariably take with them a book consisting solely of<br>blank pages, nicely bound, which they call an <i>Album Amicorum</i>.<br>Armed with this, they make a point of calling on the<br>various learned men of the locality they happen to be visiting,<br>and beg them to inscribe their names in it.<br>&nbsp;<br>This German of ours is not afraid of hard work. He must<br>needs scale the highest peaks; track the course of the rivers,<br>from their source to the sea, carefully noting down all the<br>fords, ferries, and bridges; explore the ruins of amphitheatres<br>and temples, and, notebook in hand, visit all the<br>churches, abbeys, convents, public buildings, town-halls,<br>aqueducts, forts, arsenals; he must make copies of the<br>epitaphs on the tombs; he must not omit belfries, chimes,<br>church-clocks from his purview. Yet he will not hesitate<br>to turn his back on it all, and rush off post-haste, at the first<br>hint that the coronation of the King of France is about to<br>take place, or that a new Emperor is to be elected.<br>The English travelled as a way of putting the finishing<br>touch on their education. Young gentlemen just down from<br>Oxford or Cambridge, liberally furnished with funds, and<br>attended by a staid and sober-minded tutor, crossed the Straits and set out to make the <i>grand tour</i>. They were birds<br>Iof every feather, these young men. Some thought they had<br>done all that was expected of them when they had sampled<br>the wines of Frontignan and Montefiascone, of Ay and<br>Arbois, of Bordeaux and Xeres. Others, bent on self-improvement,<br>conscientiously examined every cabinet of<br>natural history specimens, every collection of antiques.<br>Every man to his taste!<br>&nbsp;<br>The French usually travel to save money, so that they sometimes<br>leave the places where they sojourn worse off than they<br>found them. The English, on the other hand, come over with<br>plenty of cash, plenty of gear, and servants to wait on them.<br>They throw their money about like lords. It is reckoned that in<br>Rome alone there are, in the ordinary way, upwards of six<br>hundred English gentlemen, all with people in their pay, and<br>that, taking everything into account, they spend at least two<br>thousand crowns per head every year, so that Rome alone derives<br>from England a yearly revenue of thirty thousand pistoles,<br>good and sound.<br>&nbsp;<br>And in Paris, too, 'where there is never any lack of English visitors; an English business man assured me the other<br>day that he had paid out to Englishmen in France a hundred<br>and thirty thousand crowns in a single year, and he<br>was by no means one of the biggest bankers either'. It is<br>Gregorio Leti who tells us that, Gregorio Leti, adventurer<br>and globe-trotter, who had at least five countries he could<br>call his own. Born at Milan, he turned Calvinist at Geneva,<br>became Louis XIV's panegyrist in Paris, England's historian<br>in London, and government pamphleteer in Holland,<br>where he died in 1701. Men of learning added to their stores<br>of erudition as they journeyed from city to city, like that<br>Antonio Conti, for example, a native of Padua, who, in<br>1713, was in Paris, and two years later in London, where<br>he took part in the controversy concerning the infinitesimal<br>calculus. After that, he went to Hanover to confer with<br>Leibniz, and on his way through Holland did not fail to pay<br>a visit to Leeuwenhoek. Philosophers went abroad, not to<br>go and meditate in peace in some quiet retreat, but to see<br>the wonders of the world. Such were Locke and Leibniz.<br>Monarchs, too, indulged in foreign travel; Christina of<br>Sweden died at Rome in 1689; and Peter the Great set out<br>for Europe in 1696.<br>Travel literature, with its indeterminate frontiers, provided<br>a convenient reservoir for the most diverse material,<br>from the dissertations of the learned, to museum-catalogues<br>and love-stories, and so it came to the fore. It might take the<br>shape of a&nbsp; weighty discourse chock-full of the most erudite matter; it might be a study in psychology; it might be a<br>plain, straightforward novel; or it might be a combination of all three. It had its eulogIsts; it had its detractors: But,<br>praise or blame, both made clear the important place it had<br>come to occupy, and indicated that it was not&nbsp; thing to be ignored. The same tendencies that fostered its popularity<br>necessarily entailed the production of guide-books, itineraries, and the like . There was a large assortment to<br>choose from: <i>Le Gentilhomme �tranger voyageur en</i><br><i>France</i>; <i>Il Burattino veridico, ovvero Istruzione generale</i><br><i>per chi, viaggia</i>; <i>Guia de los caminos para ir por todas las provincias de Espa�a, Francia, Italia, y Alemania.</i> Cities and<br>towns of outstanding historic importance are treated in<br>separate volumes, e.g. <i>The City and republic of Venice</i>; <i>Description of Rome for the use of foreigners</i>; <i>A Guide for the use of foreigners desirous of seeing and understanding the most notable things in the royal city of Naples</i>; <i>An</i><br><i>up-to-date description of all the most remarkable features</i><br><i>of the city of Paris</i>. There is one alluring title that makes<br>you feel as if you were already glimpsing the fair scenes<br>which it promises and that you really must book your seat on the coach 'Delight' is the operative word.<br>The 'Delights', or the 'Charms, of this country and of that - of Italy, of Denmark and Norway, of Great Britain<br>and Ireland, of Switzerland. Finally, when all these<br>'Delights' are rolled into one, we have The Wonders of<br>Europe'!<br>&nbsp;<br>Attractive as these things were, the 'Wonders of the<br>World' outdid them. Indeed, from this time forth, Europe<br>never ceased to explore and exploit the world at large; the<br>seventeenth century thus resuming the task which the<br>sixteenth had bequeathed it. As far back as 1619, an obscure<br>writer, P. Bergeron by name, and a little later, in 1636,<br>Tommaso Campanella, were putting forth this sort of thing:<br>'The exploration of the globe having resulted in discoveries<br>that have destroyed many of the data on which ancient<br>philosophy reposed, a new conception of things will inevitably<br>be called for.' This idea, which at first gained ground<br>but slowly, received a marked impetus when the Dutch not<br>only opened up trade with the East Indies, but gave picturesque<br>accounts of the strange things they found there;<br>when the English not only displayed their flag in all the<br>oceans of the globe, but described their voyages in the most<br>marvellously circumstantial literature of the kind the world<br>had ever seen; when Colbert told the French people of rich<br>territories and treasures in lands beyond the seas, and<br>recommended them as fitting fields for enterprise. How<br>many were the glowing reports and stirring tales, compiled<br>by order of the king, that came to France from 'over<br>yonder'! How little did His Majesty dream that from those<br>very tales would spring ideas calculated to unsettle some of<br>the beliefs he held most dear, beliefs essential to the maintenance<br>of his royal authority.<br>Thus the spate of travel-books, Narratives, Descriptions,<br>Reports, Collections, Series, Miscellanea, continued to swell<br>till it overflowed all reasonable limits. Gentlemen sitting<br>comfortably at home by the fireside learnt all there was to<br>know about the Great American Lakes, the Gardens of<br>Malabar, the Pagodas of China, and a host of things they<br>would never behold at first hand. The good fathers of the<br>Foreign Missions, Capuchins, Franciscans, Recollets, Jesuits,<br>told of the conversion of the heathen; escaped captives from<br>Tunis, Algiers, or Morocco gave harrowing descriptions of<br>the tortures they had suffered for their faith. Medical men<br>in the service of the trading companies duly reported results of their scientific observations. Navigators gave the<br>most vivid accounts of their voyages round the world, and<br>the names of Dampier, Gemelli Carreri, Woodes-Rogers<br>were household words for all.

It paints a vivid picture of his childhood in Crete, and then steadily grows into a spiritual quest that takes him to Italy, Jerusalem, Paris, Vienna, Berlin and Russia.</p><p>Nikos Kazantzakis was born in 1883 in Herakleion on the island of Crete. During the Cretan revolt of 1897 his family was sent to the island of Naxos, where he attended the French School of the Holy Cross. From 1902 to 1906 he studied law at Athens University. He worked first as a journalist and throughout a long career wrote several plays, travel journals and translations. His remarkable travels began in 1907 and there were few countries in Europe or Asia that he didn&#39;t visit. He studied Buddhism in Vienna and later belonged to a group of radical intellectuals in Berlin, where he began his great epic The Odyssey, which he completed in 1938. He didn&#39;t start writing novels until he was almost 60 and completed his most famous work, Zorba the Greek, in 1946. Other novels include Freedom and Death (1953) and The Last Temptation (1954), which the Vatican placed on the Index. Return to Greco, an autobiographical novel, was published in 1961.Nikos Kazantzakis finally settled in Antibes with his second wife, and died there from leukaemia in October 1957. He is buried at Herakleion, where the epitaph on his tomb reads: &#39;I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free&#39;.</p><h2>Training of the American Actor</h2><p><p><i>Successful acting must reflect a society&#x2019;s current beliefs.

Wells's The War of the Worlds remains one of the most influential science fiction novels ever published.</b><br><br>The night after a shooting star is seen streaking through the sky from Mars, a cylinder is discovered on Horsell Common in London. At first, na�ve locals approach the cylinder armed just with a white flag - only to be quickly killed by an all-destroying heat-ray, as terrifying tentacled invaders emerge. Soon the whole of human civilisation is under threat, as powerful Martians build gigantic killing machines, destroy all in their path with black gas and burning rays, and feast on the warm blood of trapped, still-living human prey. The forces of the Earth, however, may prove harder to beat than they at first appear. <i>The War of the Worlds </i>has been the subject of countless adaptations, including an Orson Welles radio drama which caused mass panic when it was broadcast, with listeners confusing it for a news broadcast heralding alien invasion; a musical version by Jeff Wayne; and, most recently, Steven Spielberg's 2005 film version, starring Tom Cruise. <br><br>This Penguin Classics edition includes a full biographical essay on Wells, a further reading list and detailed notes. The introduction, by Brian Aldiss, considers the novel's view of religion and society.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..." <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. <i>--Craig E.

Fourteen poisons. Just because it's fiction doesn't mean it's all made-up . . . </p><p>Agatha Christie reveled in the use of poison to kill off unfortunate victims in her books; indeed, she employed it more than any other murder method, with the poison itself often being a central part of the novel. Her choice of deadly substances was far from random--the characteristics of each often provide vital clues to the discovery of the murderer. With gunshots or stabbings the cause of death is obvious, but this is not the case with poisons. How is it that some compounds prove so deadly, and in such tiny amounts?</p><p>Christie's extensive chemical knowledge provides the backdrop for <i>A is for Arsenic</i>, in which Kathryn Harkup investigates the poisons used by the murderer in fourteen classic Agatha Christie mysteries. It looks at why certain chemicals kill, how they interact with the body, the cases that may have inspired Christie, and the feasibility of obtaining, administering and detecting these poisons, both at the time the novel was written and today. <i>A is for Arsenic</i> is a celebration of the use of science by the undisputed Queen of Crime.</p></p><p><b>Kathryn Harkup</b> is a chemist and author. Kathryn completed a doctorate on her favorite chemicals, phosphines, and went on to further postdoctoral research before realizing that talking, writing and demonstrating science appealed a bit more than hours slaving over a hot fume-hood. For six years she ran the outreach in engineering, computing, physics and maths at the University of Surrey, which involved writing talks on science topics that would appeal to bored teenagers (anything disgusting or dangerous was usually the most popular). Kathryn is now a freelance science communicator delivering talks and workshops on the quirky side of science.<p>"Remember the homicidal glee of that old Cary Grant movie 'Arsenic and Old Lace'? Those adorable aged aunts, earnestly luring lonely old men to their house so they could knock them off with poison-laced elderberry wine? If you liked that, you&#x2019;ll like A IS FOR ARSENIC: THE POISONS OF AGATHA CHRISTIE; it has a little of that lethal charm . . . And while it&#x2019;s essentially good book-club-style fun, the book has a practical application: For every poison, it offers some antidotes." &#x2015;<i>Washington Post</i> </p><p>"A] scholarly and enjoyable analysis of the great author&#x2019;s penchant for poison . . . if science was a banquet, then poison was her dish." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Chemist Harkup delves deep into the history and science behind more than a dozen lethal substances, introducing each through its appearance in Christie&#x2019;s writing. You don&#x2019;t have to be familiar with the likes of Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot, however, to enjoy Harkup&#x2019;s detailed, near-gleeful dip into what she calls Christie&#x2019;s deadly dispensary." &#x2015;<i>Discover</i></p><p>"If you&#x2019;re an Agatha Christie fan, read this book. If you&#x2019;re a forensic-science fan, read this book. If you know someone harboring a grudge and an unseemly interest in poison, hide this book. Harkup, a chemist, has written a knockout analysis of poisons used in Christie&#x2019;s novels and short stories . . . This is an absolutely bravura chemical compound." &#x2015;starred review, <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"Intriguing and illuminating . . . This compilation should please mystery fans, true crime readers, and lovers of popular science." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"This would be a perfect reference for anyone writing murder mysteries and is scientific enough to be used as a textbook . . . The addition of real-life cases and comparisons to Christie&#x2019;s works make this a nice little murder mystery of its own. Fear not, she&#x2019;s careful not to spoil the endings of the classic novels." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"A joy to read." &#x2015;<i>FanGirl Nation</i></p></p><h2>Christian Ethics in Plain Language (Nelson&#39;s Plain Language)</h2><p><p>This book provides a comprehensive introduction to Christian ethics, suitable for individual study or textbook use in a Bible college or seminary. The first four chapters survey of the field of Christian ethics before focusing on specific issues. Eighteen chapters confront all of the issues faced by believers today, including a discussion of racial issues that goes beyond black and white, business ethics on this side of Enron, and war and international relations in light of today's headlines.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kerby Anderson</strong> is the national director of Probe Ministries International.

The desert and time emerge as characters as Kanafani speaks through the desert, the brother, and the sister to build the powerful rhythm of the narrative. The Palestinian attachment to land and family, and the sorrow over their loss, are symbolized by the young man&#39;s unremitting anger and shame over his sister&#39;s sexual disgrace. This collection of stories provides evidence to the English-reading public of Kanafani&#39;s position within modern Arabic literature. Not only was he committed to portraying the miseries and aspirations of his people, the Palestinians, in whose cause he died, but he was also an innovator within the extensive world of Arabic fiction.</p><p>Born in 1936 in Akka (Acre), Ghassan Kanafani was part of the 1948 exodus from Palestine. A politically active journalist in Beirut during the 1960s, Kanafani was killed in the explosion of his booby-trapped car in July 1972. He is considered a leading novelist in the Arab world."All That's Left to You . . . demonstrates Kanafani's readiness to experiment with literary styles as he probes the Palestinian experience." -- <i>Journal of Palestine Studies</i></p><h2>The Sound of Silence: The Selected Teachings of Ajahn Sumedho</h2><p>The sound of silence is like a subtlety behind everything that you awaken to; you don't notice it if you're seeking the extremes. Yet as we start to become more poised, more present, fully receptive of all this moment has to offer, we start to experience it vividly and listening to it can draw us ever--deeper into the mysteries of now.<br><br>Always skillful and good humored, Ajahn Sumedho's teachings defy boundaries. Anyone--from laypeople looking to deepen their grasp of the Buddha's message, to lifetime Buddhist monastics--will appreciate the author's sparkling insights into to such key Buddhist themes as awareness, consciousness, identity, relief from suffering, and mindfulness of the body. <i>The Sound of Silence</i> represents the best of Ajahn Sumedho's masterful work to help us all see each life with a new and sustaining clarity.</p><p>Ajahn Amaro is abbot of the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in southeast England and author of numerous books and articles on Buddhist themes across traditions. Born in England in 1956, Ven. Amaro received his BSc. in Psychology and Physiology from the University of London. He studied Buddhism in Thailand in the Forest Tradition and was ordained as a bhikkhu by Thai meditation master Ajahn Chah at Wat Pah Nanachat in 1979. He returned to England and joined Ajahn Sumedho at the newly established Chithurst Monastery. He resided for many years at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in England, and in 1996 he established Abhayagiri Monastery in Redwood Valley, California. He lived there until 2010, when he was called back to Amaravati to assume the duties of abbot.</p><h2>Liberating the Gospels: Reading the Bible with Jewish Eyes</h2><p><p> In this boldest book since <i>Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism,</i> Bishop John Shelby Spong offers a compelling view of the Gospels as thoroughly Jewish tests.Spong powerfully argues that many of the key Gospel accounts of events in the life of Jesus&#x2014;from the stories of his birth to his physical resurrection&#x2014;are not literally true. He offers convincing evidence that the Gospels are a collection of Jewish midrashic stories written to convey the significance of Jesus. This remarkable discovery brings us closer to how Jesus was really understood in his day and should be in ours. </p></p><p>Bishop John Shelby Spong's name and work have become nearly synonymous with the word <i>controversy.</i> His books have challenged traditional Christian teachings on sexual morality, on the literal interpretation of the Bible, and on the understanding of women--among other hot-button issues in both the church and the popular culture. <i>Liberating the Gospels</i> continues this tradition as Spong reveals his most provocative argument to date--that Christians have misread Jesus and the Gospels for centuries by ignoring the thoroughly Jewish content below the surface of the New Testament. <p>With a keen eye and years of deliberate investigation, Spong traces the long period of history in which the Gospels were "cut away from the essential Jewishness" and interpreted as if they were primarily gentile books, distorting their meaning with a deeply prejudiced anti-Jewish bias. To remedy both that bias and the continued misinterpretation of the Gospels' message, Spong believes we must recognize the Gospels as the thoroughly Jewish books they are and learn to read them with a clear understanding of the Jewish context, frame of reference, vocabulary, and history that shaped and informed them. </p><p>By connecting the Gospels to the style of the Jewish <i>midrashic</i> literature of Jesus' era, he shows how the Gospel authors intended their stories to be perceived, not as historical accounts of actual events, but rather as interpretive narratives about the meaning of Jesus, using images and themes from the Hebrew Bible. Some examples of his fascinating arguments and conclusions are: </p><p>The significant events of Jesus' life follow an orderly cycle of Jewish feasts and rites of passage. </p><p>Judas never existed but was a fictional scapegoat created to shift the blame for Jesus' death from the Romans to the Jews. </p><p>Leading characters of Jewish scripture make cameo appearances in the Gospels. </p><p>Stories about Jesus, from the infancy narratives to the resurrection, can all be freshly understood as interpretive tales based on key passages in the Old Testament. </p><p>Like any good detective story, <i>Liberating the Gospels</i> is a riveting account of facts and theories coming together, piece by piece, to form a brilliant, convincing whole. Spong approaches the Gospels with reverence and a determination to restore their meaning, their vivid historical context, and the respect so long eroded between Christians and Jews. The result is a remarkable revisioning of Jesus and the Gospels that brings us closer to how Jesus was really understood in his day and should be in ours.</p>As politicians battle over the moral heart of the nation, the outspoken and controversial Bishop John Shelby Spong brings us his boldest book yet. <i>Liberating the Gospels</i> reclaims the original Jewish context and meaning of the Gospels, revealing how Christians have misread them--and Jesus--for centuries by disregarding the thoroughly Jewish substance at the core of the New Testament. His goal, Spong writes, is to restore "the power present in the Scriptures for our time." <p>"Compelling, controversial, substantive, provocative, and original...remarkably convincing." (Rabbi Jack D. Spiro, director, Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Judaic Studies) </p><p>"Throughout his career as an Episcopal priest and bishop, John Shelby Spong has been surrounded by controversy as he has labored on the leading edge of movements to bring blacks, women, and homosexuals into the full life of his church."

In addition to North America, they occur in Europe, Asia, Eurasia, Central America and Africa. They have many names, such as girolle, gallinacci or pfifferling, depending on where you live. Chanterelles are often light orange to yellow, funnel-shaped and meaty. As some of the most commonly sought wild mushrooms, they are truly an international delight! </p><p>The French first brought chanterelles into the culinary world back in the eighteenth century. The rich, firm body and delicate flavor made these mushrooms a favorite among discriminating chefs. </p><p>Today, Poland is the world&#x2019;s largest exporter of wild mushrooms, including the chanterelle. Many thousands of pounds of chanterelles, along with other mushroom species, are pickled and packed in jars and sold around the world. Sometimes you can find chanterelles in dishes at finer restaurants, when in season. One of the reasons they are so prized is for their eye appeal at the table. So far, they have resisted being cultivated and grown for production. </p><p>Chanterelles grow in multiples of up to several dozen, usually in mixed forests, and typically in shaded areas with a fair amount of moss or leaf litter. In some parts of the country, such as the upper Midwest, they are associated with conifers. In the western and eastern United States, they are associated with oak and beech trees. In other parts of the country, they can be found in birch forests. </p><p>Summer and fall are the best seasons for chanterelles. They are highly dependent on abundant rainfall. Once you find a chanterelle, stop and look around because there are usually many more. Chanterelles rarely fruit one at a time. </p><p>Chanterelles are usually pale orange or egg-yolk yellow. Less commonly, they are white. They have a distinct funnel shape, often with a wavy, rolled edge on the cap. </p><p>Underneath the cap are gill-like ridges that may feel waxy and run partially down the stem. These are considered false gills because they can&#x2019;t be cleanly separated from the cap or stem. The ridges fork (bifurcate), so look closely for them to divide. The stem tapers to the thinnest point at the surface of the ground. </p><p>Chanterelles are stout, full-bodied mushrooms, and they just feel good in your hands&#x2015;not delicate at all. They have a very earthy aroma and smell delicious, often with a hint of apricot. The flavor is outstanding! Of course, they taste mainly like mushrooms, but they have a faint flavor of oak. </p><p>Some chanterelles stand 2&#x2013;3 inches (5&#x2013;7.5 cm) tall, with the very largest reaching 5&#x2013;6 inches (13&#x2013;15 cm). No matter the size, all are edible. They often grow in groups of over 20&#x2013;30 mushrooms. Given the right conditions, you can gather many hundreds in one afternoon! </p><p>Chanterelles are fairly nutritious. They contain vitamin C and potassium, along with high levels of vitamin D. They hold up well during the cooking process, making them perfect and fun to use in recipes that call for lots of mushrooms. They are also excellent for pickling. They don&#x2019;t fall apart during pickling and pack well into jars. </p><p><b>SPORE PRINT</b> </p><p>There isn&#x2019;t one specific spore print color for the chanterelles. Prints range from yellow to creamy white and light pink to dark salmon. Chanterelle spore prints are extremely difficult to obtain....</p></p><h2>1001 Great Ideas for Teaching and Raising Children with Autism or Asperger&#39;s, Revised and Expanded 2nd Edition</h2><p>Winner of&nbsp; a Silver medal in the Independent Publishers Book Awards and <i>Learning Magazine</i>'s Teachers Choice Award, <i>1001 Great Ideas </i>has been a treasured resource in the autism community since 2004.

Although some background in the TCP/IP protocols is helpful, you can learn a great deal from this text about the protocols themselves and their uses. And if you already have a base knowledge of C, you can use the book's code walkthroughs to figure out exactly what this sophisticated part of the Linux kernel is doing.</p><p>Part of the difficulty in understanding networks -- and implementing them -- is that the tasks are broken up and performed at many different times by different pieces of code. One of the strengths of this book is to integrate the pieces and reveal the relationships between far-flung functions and data structures. <i>Understanding Linux Network Internals</i> is both a big-picture discussion and a no-nonsense guide to the details of Linux networking. Topics include:</p><ul><li>Key problems with networking</li><li>Network interface card (NIC) device drivers</li><li>System initialization</li><li>Layer 2 (link-layer) tasks and implementation</li><li>Layer 3 (IPv4) tasks and implementation</li><li>Neighbor infrastructure and protocols (ARP)</li><li>Bridging</li><li>Routing</li><li>ICMP</li></ul><p>Author Christian Benvenuti, an operating system designer specializing in networking, explains much more than how Linux code works. He shows the purposes of major networking features and the trade-offs involved in choosing one solution over another. A large number of flowcharts and other diagrams enhance the book's understandability.</p></p><p><p>Christian Benvenuti received his masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Bologna in Italy. He collaborated for a few years with the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, where he developed ad-hoc software based on the Linux kernel, was a scientific consultant for a project on remote collaboration, and served as an instructor for several training sessions on networking. The trainings, held mainly in Europe, Africa, and South America wereall based on Linux systems and addressed to scientists from developing countries, where the ICTP has been promoting Linux for many years. He occasionally collaborates with a non-profit organization founded by ICTP members, Collaborium.org, to continue promoting Linux on developing countries.In the past few years he worked as a software engineer for Cisco Systems in the Silicon Valley, where he focused on Layer two switching, high availability, and network security.</p>"Anyone who works with Linux networking should have a copy to hand to help with those inexplicable problems and to better understand how it all works." - James Millen, BJHC &amp; IM, November 2006</p><h2>A Natural History of Latin</h2><p>No known language, including English, has achieved the success and longevity of Latin. French, Spanish, Italian, and Romanian are among its direct descendants, and countless Latin words and phrases comprise the cornerstone of English itself. <em>A Natural History or Latin</em> tells its history from its origins over 2500 years ago to the present. Brilliantly conceived, popularizing but authoritative, and written with the fluency and light touch that have made Tore Janson's <em>Speak</em> so attractive to tens of thousands of readers, it is a masterpiece of adroit synthesis.<br> <br> The book commences with a description of the origins, emergence, and dominance of Latin over the Classical period. Then follows an account of its survival through the Middle Ages into modern times, with emphasis on its evolution throughout the history, culture, and religious practices of Medieval Europe. By judicious quotation of Latin words, phrases, and texts the author illustrates how the written and spoken language changed, region by region over time; how it met resistance from native languages; and how therefore some entire languages disappeared. Janson offers a vivid demonstration of the value of Latin as a means of access to a vibrant past and a persuasive argument for its continued worth. A concise and easy-to-understand introduction to Latin grammar and a list of the most frequent Latin words, including 500 idioms and phrases still in common use, complement the work.<br></p><p><br><strong>Tore Janson</strong> was Professor of Oriental and African Languages at the University of G�teborg until his retirement in 2000. He was previously Professor of Linguistics at the same university and a world expert on the history of Latin. He is the author of the international bestseller <em>Speak: A Short</em> <em>History of Languages</em> (OUP 2002; trade paperback 2003).<br><br>"...valuable is the enthusiasm [Janson] directs to the history of Latin words and the variety of their uses (with attention even to such divagations as the "Latin" spells in the Harry Potter books). The translators do a fine job of Anglicizing both the language and the cultural assumptions...Recommended"--CHOICE<p></p><br>"An authoritative introduction to arguably the most influential language of all time."--<em>Chicago Tribune</em><p></p><br>"Janson...comes not to praise the Romans but instead the <em>lingua Latina,</em> whose evolution he traces from its origin some 2,700 years ago as a local language to its apotheosis as the official language of the Roman Empire--and later, when it was no longer anyone's native tongue, of the victorious Christian religion--to an exercise forced upon schoolchildren. He also offers an enthusiastic appreciation of Latin's role, for the better part of yet another millennium, as the language of enlightened Europeans from Chaucer and Abelard to Erasmus, Galileo, Newton, and Rene 'Cogito, ergo sum' Descartes. Nor does he fail to point out Latin's enduring place in medicine, botany, and zoology--or its more recent uses, from Oscar Wilde's 'De Profundis' to the first names of J.K. Rowling's 'Harry Potter' characters, including Albus ('White') Dumbledore."--<em>Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"In the hands of a teacher introducing students to Latin, the classics, or to general themes in Western history, this book could be very useful. ... May the Latin is Important movement, assisted by books like Janson's, prosper."--<em>Books &amp; Culture</em><p></p><br>"It is hard to imagine how this book could be improved. ...from now on, if anyone who has never studied Latin asks me to recommend a short, readable book in which they can find out about the history of Latin and get a feel for the grammar, I will be able to answer unhesitatingly."--<em>Linguist List</em> <em>16.965</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Functional Analytic Psychotherapy Made Simple: A Practical Guide to Therapeutic Relationships</h2><p><b>Cowritten with the founders of functional analytic psychotherapy,&nbsp;<i>Functional Analytic Psychotherapy Made Simple</i> offers a practical, behavioral treatment approach focused on client interpersonal relationships and the therapeutic relationship.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP) is a research-based treatment for mental health disorders and has been shown to enhance the quality of interpersonal relationships.

The skill of functional analysis can be applied broadly, and this book explains this skill in a way that is easy to understand and apply. Functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP) is about consciously moving into conversation with courage, awareness, and love. This book embodies this beautifully.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Rachel Collis</b>, executive coach; MBA lecturer, Queensland University of Technology, Australia<br><br>&#x201c;For clinicians who want their therapy relationships to improve their clients&#x2019; lives, this book is the place to start. A delight to read, <i>Functional Analytic Psychotherapy Made Simple</i> provides a clear and compassionate guide to helping therapists be present, supportive, and responsive to clients.&nbsp;The book is chock-full of vivid clinical examples, tools and worksheets, and helpful solutions for getting unstuck in therapy. The result is an excellent foundation for therapists to develop powerful curative relationships with clients, while being seamlessly grounded in the principles of behaviorism that underlie this therapy. Coming over a quarter century since the seminal book on FAP was released, and distilling the authors&#x2019; forty-plus years of wisdom and experience, the book is a true achievement. <i>Functional Analytic Psychotherapy Made Simple </i>is destined to become a gem in any clinician&#x2019;s library. I wish I had this book when I first learned FAP many years ago.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Jonathan B. Bricker, PhD</b>, behavioral scientist, psychology professor, and practicing FAP therapist<br><br><br>&#x201c;After haunting psychotherapy theory for a century, the personal relationship between therapist and client has come to its own as the most powerful tool for therapeutic change. This book explains why and how the personal relationship is essential in the treatment of psychological problems. Seldom has a single volume covered such a broad array of skills and such depths of understanding. Weaving samples of clinical conversation into theory, it makes the complexities of the psychotherapy process&#x2014;not so much simple, but rather&#x2014;crystal clear.

It offers a sound introduction to FAP, with excellent examples and coherent explanations of what FAP deems to be its core foci. It also works well as an extended description and discussion of the core concept of functional analysis, which is sadly missing from the existing literature. I am frequently asked to explain and illustrate functional analysis, and in the future I will be citing this work as the answer. Although it aims to &#x2018;make simple,&#x2019; the work is also adequately scholarly. It uses an appropriate level of citations, often missing in similar texts, which undermines the credibility of the proposed arguments. The level of detail provided on relevant studies is also perfect for the target audience. At a more general therapeutic level, the book highlights a very comprehensive and thorough understanding of issues central to competent therapeutic work (e.g., closure).&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;</b><b>Yvonne Barnes-Holmes</b>, associate professor of behavior analysis in the department of experimental clinical and health psychology, and faculty of psychology and educational studies at Ghent University in Belgium<br><br>&#x201c;Awareness, courage, and love&#x2014;these are words that many may instinctively deem &#x2018;unprofessional&#x2019; in the context of psychotherapy. However, in this beautifully written book, readers look through the lens of functional analysis. This therapeutic stance and the activities referred to in this ACL framework are vital to the psychotherapeutic relationship, and lie at the core of FAP. The book will appeal to both those who enjoy a good empirically based model and those who are moved by philosophy&#x2014;or those who respond to both. Students, new professionals, and clinicians that have been in practice for many years will benefit from the insights and exercises offered in this wonderful book.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;</b><b>Christopher R.

Rather than offering recipes for specific techniques, master storyteller Robert Stake stimulates readers to discover "how things work" in organizations, programs, communities, and other systems. Topics range from identifying a research question to selecting methods, gathering data, interpreting and analyzing the results, and producing a well-thought-through written report. In-depth examples from actual studies emphasize the role of the researcher as instrument and interpreter, while boxed vignettes and learning projects encourage self-reflection and critical thinking. Other useful pedagogical features include quick-reference tables and charts, sample project management forms, and an end-of-book glossary. After reading this book, doctoral students and novice qualitative researchers will be able to plan a study from beginning to end.</p></p><p><p> &nbsp;</p>Robert E. Stake is Director of the Center for Instructional Research and Curriculum Evaluation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is one of several educational researchers who created theory and practice for educational program evaluation in the 1960s. His responsive evaluation approach emphasizes the study of classroom experience, personal interaction, and institutional processes and contexts, often in the form of case studies. Among the evaluative studies he has directed are studies in science and arts education; model programs; and conventional teaching, including higher education, special education and, with Bernadine Evans Stake, gender equity. He is a recipient of the Special Career Award in Qualitative Inquiry from the International Congress for Qualitative Inquiry, the Lazarsfeld Award from the American Evaluation Association, and the Presidential Citation from the American Educational Research Association, and holds honorary doctorates from the University of Uppsala, Sweden, and the University of Valladolid, Spain. For many years, Dr. Stake has been a prominent voice in a transatlantic "invisible college" of like-minded evaluators questioning contexts and conventions for educational evaluation and infusing evaluation with fairness and a valuing of experience.<p> &nbsp;</p>"Stake invites readers in, sits down with us, and shares what he has learned about qualitative research from years of first-hand experience. His discussion, supported with helpful examples, cases, and concept maps, is theoretically grounded but at the same time user friendly. Taking readers on a masterful and engaging journey from understanding what qualitative research is all about, to designing a study, to writing the final report, this book has something for both new and experienced qualitative researchers and practitioners across the social sciences."--Sharan B. Merriam, EdD, Department of Lifelong Education, Administration and Policy (Emeritus), University of Georgia&nbsp;"For those who have never had the privilege of taking a class with Stake, this book is the next best thing. It is truly written in his voice, with his timing, pacing, clarity, directness, and humor. Each chapter is a small adventure, shaped by decades of practice, filled with authentic examples, and replete with fertile resources from a lifetime of reading that has never been limited to program evaluation or pure scholarly work. Rather, Stake's examples tie in the history of science, philosophy, great literature, and other markers of renaissance men and women everywhere. This is his best, most fascinating and engaging work thus far."--Yvonna Lincoln, PhD, Distinguished Professor and Ruth Harrington Endowed Chair of Educational Leadership, Texas A&amp;M University&nbsp;"This remarkable book tells us clearly how qualitative research works. It distills the author's lifetime of experience in qualitative inquiry, addressing the aims and conduct of such research in ways that are cogent and wise. Expert and novice researchers alike will find much to learn here. The author's direct, modest voice almost belies the sophistication of his discussion of key issues of theory and method in qualitative inquiry. A special feature is the inclusion of lengthy examples from actual studies, which show fundamental processes of decision in the collection, analysis, reporting, and interpreting of evidence."--Frederick Erickson, PhD, George F. Kneller Professor of Anthropology of Education, University of California, Los Angeles&nbsp;"This is a very readable book. Stake doesn't tell students what to do, but helps them think about their work in ways that will improve their research questions, data collection, and analysis. The emphasis on <i>thinking about research</i> is missing from many qualitative textbooks, and is the reason why this one will be mandatory reading for my advisees who plan to use qualitative methods in their dissertations. An important contribution."--Janet Usinger, PhD, Department of Educational Leadership, University of Nevada, Reno<br><br> "Using as few words as possible, the author has communicated the complex nuances of qualitative research: its assumptions, purposes, and methods. From the identification of the research topic and generation of research questions to the gathering and analysis of the varieties of qualitative data, Stake guides the reader through the process of conducting and interpreting research and writing a report. This book will become a handbook for novices as well as veterans who pursue qualitative research. I used it extensively giving Fulbright lectures in Mexico."--Robert Louisell, EdD, Professor Emeritus, St. Cloud State University, Minnesota<br><br>"A strength of Stake's writing is that he uses examples from a range of topics, projects, and people to describe the points he discusses. He uses examples from graduate students who have been successful, from colleagues he has worked with, and from his own research. This breadth of examples gives the reader multiple perspectives of how qualitative practices can be used and are applicable to all types of projects, formal or informal, large or small, individual or collaborative. Throughout his book, Stake (2010) makes the effort to engage the reader by using a conversational tone and a style that makes the content clear and concise, without sounding overly simplistic....In addition, the effort by Stake early in the book to introduce himself to the reader gives a sense of personalization and collegiality....Provides the reader with various 'tasks' and critical thinking 'assignments' that one can use as practice, to reiterate many of the ideas conveyed in this book....Stake makes it clear to the reader that both qualitative and quantitative aspects exist in any study, and that the lines between the two are not always as clear as they may seem, overlapping and complementing each other in both obvious and subtle ways....A range of scholars and academics would find this book very useful....Beginning graduate students, whether on their own or with a class, would be wise to use this book as a starting point in thinking about the basics of qualitative research, as well as some of the complexities that come with it. This is also a book they may want to keep around, for future reference, once they have a solid grasp of those basics. More advanced students and researchers would benefit from Stake's clear descriptions of some of the finer nuances of qualitative research and inquiry, as well as his focus on duality....I anticipate this being a book I can use again and again, each time gaining a clearer understanding of the complex process of studying how things work. Overall, the way in which Stake's book 'works' is through his ability to be fully invested in the reader using only paper and ink; to use clear, concise description, coupled with the challenge to think about issues deeply and complexly, to support readers as well as challenge them; to make strategies adaptable to small or large studies; to give an overview of the concepts, assumptions, processes and procedures of qualitative design and encourage readers to struggle with the intricacies and specificities of their own research. Stake encourages readers to take on an active role in the study of qualitative research, consider its relationships and uses, and question what will work in their own inquiry.", <i>Qualitative Report</i> Published On: 2010-03-05<br><br>"The book is written with great clarity and offers important ideas and smart suggestions to the reader....The book begins by outlining 18 practical projects that could be accomplished as part of a qualitative research course....These projects are sensible and provide students with opportunities to gain needed skills. The book is also written at multiple levels of sophistication, so that an experienced researcher will find much useful discussion of purposes and meaning of qualitative research, while the less experienced graduate students preparing dissertation research will find useful strategies and rules-of-thumb. For someone&#x2015;like me&#x2015;planning to teach a course on qualitative research methods, Stake provides a good balance of qualitative research strategies with practical illustrations of methods and a deeper discussion of the place of qualitative work in the research community and in the world....Every chapter in Robert Stake's Qualitative Research is thoughtful, and presents a richly textured understanding of what qualitative research tries to accomplish and how it furthers our understanding of human experience. The combination of clear writing, practical guidelines, and illustrative examples, makes for a great book. I have ordered the book for a doctoral level course on qualitative research methods that I will be teaching next semester. I would adopt the book as a required text in qualitative inquiry and qualitative methods courses aimed at graduate students in education and other professional disciplines such as public policy or public affairs. Qualitative Research is also a great read for anyone interested in understanding how the world works.", <i>Education Review</i> Published On: 2010-03-05<br><br>"A rich and thoughtful text....Perhaps the principal virtue of Stake's book is arguably its practicality. Large parts of Stake's book read as a kind of manual for qualitative researchers....Graduate students faced with the subtleties of writing up qualitative researchand there are many such subtletieswould be well advised to consult it....Stake goes a long way toward showing how qualitative research works....And he does so with a careful measure of practical wisdom....Stake has done a splendid job introducing both beginning and more experienced readers to the field of qualitative research, and he has done this in such a way as to convey a clear, practical sense of how good qualitative research should be done. The book should be read by students, teachers, practitioners, and anyone else who seeks to understand the human enterprise in a methodical and disciplined way."<i></i>, <i>Canadian Journal of Program Evaluation</i> Published On: 2013-05-28</p><h2>The History of Statistics: The Measurement of Uncertainty before 1900</h2><p><p>This magnificent book is the first comprehensive history of statistics from its beginnings around 1700 to its emergence as a distinct and mature discipline around 1900. Stephen M. Stigler shows how statistics arose from the interplay of mathematical concepts and the needs of several applied sciences including astronomy, geodesy, experimental psychology, genetics, and sociology. He addresses many intriguing questions: How did scientists learn to combine measurements made under different conditions? And how were they led to use probability theory to measure the accuracy of the result? Why were statistical methods used successfully in astronomy long before they began to play a significant role in the social sciences? How could the introduction of least squares predate the discovery of regression by more than eighty years? On what grounds can the major works of men such as Bernoulli, De Moivre, Bayes, Quetelet, and Lexis be considered partial failures, while those of Laplace, Galton, Edgeworth, Pearson, and Yule are counted as successes? How did Galton&#x2019;s probability machine (the quincunx) provide him with the key to the major advance of the last half of the nineteenth century?</p><p>Stigler&#x2019;s emphasis is upon how, when, and where the methods of probability theory were developed for measuring uncertainty in experimental and observational science, for reducing uncertainty, and as a conceptual framework for quantitative studies in the social sciences. He describes with care the scientific context in which the different methods evolved and identifies the problems (conceptual or mathematical) that retarded the growth of mathematical statistics and the conceptual developments that permitted major breakthroughs.</p><p>Statisticians, historians of science, and social and behavioral scientists will gain from this book a deeper understanding of the use of statistical methods and a better grasp of the promise and limitations of such techniques. The product of ten years of research, <i>The History of Statistics</i> will appeal to all who are interested in the humanistic study of science.</p></p><p>Stephen M.

It is now the third leading cause of death for fifteen- to twenty-four-year-olds in the United States, raising alarms across the nation about the rising tide of hopelessness seen in our young people. It is a taboo subtext to our successes and our happiness, a dark issue that is often euphemized, avoided, and little understood. In our century, psychology and psychiatry alike have attempted to understand, prevent, and medicalize these phenomena. But they have failed, argues Dr. Edwin Shneidman, because they have lost sight of the plain language, the ordinary everyday words, the pain and frustrated psychological needs of the suicidal individual.<br> In <em>The Suicidal Mind,</em> Dr. Shneidman has written a groundbreaking work for every person who has ever thought about suicide or knows anybody who has contemplated it. The book brims with insight into the suicidal impulse and with helpful suggestions on how to counteract it. Shneidman presents a bold and simple premise: the main cause of suicide is psychological pain or "psychache." Thus the key to preventing suicide is not so much the study of the structure of the brain, or the study of social statistics, or the study of mental diseases, as it is the direct study of human emotions. To treat a suicidal individual, we need to identify, address, and reduce the individual's psychache. Shneidman shares with the reader his knowledge, both as a clinician and researcher, of the psychological drama that plays itself out in the suicidal mind through the exploration of three moving case studies. We meet Ariel, who set herself on fire; Beatrice, who cut herself with the intent to die; and Castro, a young man who meant to shoot his brains out but survived, horribly disfigured. These cases are presented in the person's own words to reveal the details of the suicidal drama, to show that the purpose of suicide is to seek a solution, to illustrate the pain at the core of suicide, and to isolate the common stressor in suicide: frustrated psychological needs. Throughout, Shneidman offers practical, explicit maneuvers to assist in treating a suicidal individual--steps that can be taken by concerned friends or family and professionals alike.<br> Suicide is an exclusively human response to extreme psychological pain, a lonely and desperate solution for the sufferer who can no longer see any alternatives. In this landmark and elegantly written book, Shneidman provides the language, not only for understanding the suicidal mind, but for understanding ourselves. Anyone who has ever considered suicide, or knows someone who has, will find here a wealth of insights to help understand and to prevent suicide.<br></p><p><br><strong>Edwin S. Shneidman, Ph.D.,</strong> is Professor of Thanatology Emeritus at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine. He is the founder of the American Association of Suicidology, and the author of <em>Voices of Death, Definition of Suicide,</em> and <em>Deaths of Man,</em> which was nominated for a National Book Award.<br>Three case studies from the files of a UCLA thanatologist demonstrate in chilling detail that killing oneself is no easy matter. Shneidman, who limits his comments to cultures with a Judeo- Christian tradition, proposes the not especially novel idea that psychological pain, or ``psychache,'' is the primary cause of suicide. Using a form adapted from Henry A. Murray's Explorations in Personality to rate the psychological needs of individuals, he concludes that most suicides fall into five need clusters. (There is at this point a gratuitous insertion of so-called experts' assessments of the needs of Hitler, Martha Graham, Marilyn Monroe, Captain Ahab, and others.) His case studies demonstrate three of these clusters: the need to be loved, the need to strike first, and the need to belong. The first case study consists mostly of transcribed audiotapes from Ariel (pseudonyms are used throughtout), who chose self-immolation but survived with horrible burns over most of her body. Beatrice, the second case, wrote out her life story while she was Shneidman's patient; her choice was knives and starvation, and it is unclear whether her attempts at suicide have ceased. Castro, the third case, was unable to speak to Shneidman, having blown away most of his face while trying to blow his brains out, but he wrote out for him a long account of the episode, as well as many notes and letters. Shneidman sums up with a list of ten psychological commonalities of suicide--the common emotion is hopelessness/helplessness, the common action is escape, etc.--and a list of 24 psychotherapeutic maneuvers that he deems appropriate in treating potential suicides. Though providing few fresh insights, this succeeds on another level: By revealing the possible ghastly consequences of failed attempts, perhaps it may help deter some from trying to take their own lives.

I have a passion for observing enemy behavior. You watch a Nazi officer come out of a bunker, acting all high and mighty, ordering his soldiers every which way, and putting on an air of authority. The officer hasn&#x2019;t got the slightest idea that he only has seconds to live.&#x2019;<br><br>Vassili Zaitsev&#x2019;s account of the hell that was Stalingrad is moving and harrowing.

Here, the rules of war were discarded and a psychological war was being waged. In this environment, the sniper was king &#x2013; an unseen enemy who frayed the nerves of brutalised soldiers.<br><br>Zaitsev volunteered to fight at Stalingrad in 1942. His superiors recognized quickly his talent, and made him a sniper. He adapted his hunting skills to the ruins of the city, watching his prey with nerves of steel. In his first 10 days, Zaitsev killed 40 Germans. He achieved at least 225 kills and the tactics he developed are still being studied.<br><br>Zaitsev was used a symbol of Russian resistance against the Nazis. His exploits, including a famous &#x2018;duel&#x2019; with a Nazi sniper, remain the stuff of legend. His account is absorbing to anyone interested in World War II and seeing how one person could survive in the most extreme of conditions.</p><p>Vassili Zaitsev was born in 1915, and spent his early life as a hunter in the Urals. He joined the Russian navy in 1937, and volunteered for Stalingrad after hearing about the appalling losses. Zaitsev&#x2019;s mastery as a sniper became legendary, and he was awarded several times for his skill, including the coveted gold star of the Hero of the Soviet Union. He died in 1991.&#x201c;...gives an on-the-ground account of what it was like to be one of Stalingrad's defenders...

He collaborated with Drucker on many publications, including <em>The Effective Executive in Action</em>, the revised edition of <em>Management</em>, and <em>The Daily Drucker</em>.</p>T<i>he Effective Executive</i> (1966) forms one of the foundations of Drucker's reputation as a corporate leadership guru, and this workbook companion developed by Maciariello, a professor at Drucker's business management school, draws heavily upon the master source. The format extracts bullet points from the original text, along with supplementary material from other Drucker writings, then adds reinforcing questions and suggested action items. Additional space is provided to write down reflections and results. "Decision making is the specific activity of the executive," Drucker writes, but before you can learn how to make the right decisions, you need to manage your work time and concentrate your focus on the right tasks, then develop your strengths and the strengths of those around you. These precepts have become familiar mantras in the corporate environment, so little of the material should come as a surprise, making the exercises accessible and easy to perform. Key points are emphasized and re-emphasized, developed in broad themes then presented once more for individual review. If the text is repetitive, it can perhaps be forgiven by the authors' obvious desire to drill Drucker's recommended behavior into readers' heads so that it becomes consistent practice. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That cultural blight we've all experienced.<br><br>Emily Flake--keen observer of human behavior and life's less-than-triumphant moments--codifies the most common awkward hugs that have plagued us all. Filled with laugh-out-loud anecdotes and illustrations, astute observations, and wise advice, <i>That Was Awkward </i>is a heartwarming reminder that we're all in this together, grasping hastily at each other in an attempt to say: let's embrace to remind ourselves of our essential and connecting humanity, but also, please don't touch me for more than three seconds.</p><p>Emily Flake's cartoons and humorous essays run regularly in <i>The New Yorker, The Nib, </i>and many other publications.

If allowed, I will hug you upon beingintroduced, upon parting, upon your having madea particularly good joke. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I&#x2019;ma believer in the power of a good handshake (firm butnot aggro, eye contact, no weird finger waggles), but thehug is my standard as far as physical punctuation goes.<br><br>I am also, however, an awkward person. The flipside of my comfort with physical contact is a fear ofletting people see just how much I want physical contact&#x2014;I&#x2019;m a half-trained golden retriever of a woman, barely holding my seat, wagging my tail, and whining a little in my throat, hoping you&#x2019;ll pat my head so I can jump up and lick you all over your face. In my enthusiasm, I am more than likely to knock over your drink,trip over my own feet, or accidentally grope you. I am sorry, in advance.<br><br>Not so long ago, we had rules for this sort of thing. While your grandmother might not have been ableto quote Emily Post chapter-and-verse, she more thanl ikely had a sense of the broad strokes of social etiquette,or at the very least, a vague notion that such athing as good manners existed. Commonly acceptedrules for polite interaction were societal foundation garments, keeping everything in place so as to presenta smooth and jiggle-free fa�ade.<br><br>But that was then, and this is now. We are a peoplewho will wear leggings as pants. Absent a social codeand the rituals designed to express it, we are left witha general idea of &#x201c;be nice&#x201d; with no particular acceptedmethod of being so. None of us quite knows what todo with our bodies. Jiggles abound. We find ourselveslost in a world full of physical indecision and potential gaffes. Do we shake hands? Do we hug? Do we&#x2014;horrors&#x2014;kiss on the cheek? Both cheeks? Will I bonk yourforehead with mine because I cannot remember whichside I&#x2019;m supposed to kiss first? Hugs seem kind, theyseem friendly&#x2014;the Mr. Rogers-in-his-home-in-a-cardigan-and-Keds of greetings&#x2014;but absent widely understoodrules on how and where to deploy them, we&#x2019;relikely to screw those up too.<br><br>Like you, I&#x2019;ve been the giver and receiver of many awkward hugs. I&#x2019;ve witnessed them from afar and up close. I&#x2019;ve watched them take place between significant others, family members, and coworkers, each one awkward and uncommon in its own unique way. It is a universal experience, and if we can&#x2019;t agree on a socialcode anymore, the least we can do is find some warm fellow-feelings in our collective confusion. I&#x2019;ve bungled a number of hugs, and I bet you have too. I hope this book serves to let us laugh together at our foibles, and relax enough to remember that the whole point of socialniceties is nothing more than putting each other atease.

From basketball prodigy to international phenomenon to seductive commercial ideal, Michael Jordan is the supreme example of how American corporations have used technology in a brave, massively wired new world to sell their products in every corner of the globe. LaFeber's examination of Nike and its particular dominion over the global marketplace is often scathing, while his fascinating mini-biography of Michael Jordan and the commercial history of basketball reveal much about American society. For this new paperback edition, LaFeber has added a chapter on globalization in a changed world, after mass protests and since September 11. "Bold, riveting....Brilliantly illuminates how hyper-US capitalism has spread its financial wings around the globe."&#x2015;Douglas Brinkley "LaFeber brings an impressive intellect to bear on his subject."&#x2015;Barbara Rudolph, <em>Chicago Tribune</em></p><p>Not everyone embraces the "American Way." But as historian Walter LaFeber demonstrates in this highly original look at the effects of global capitalism, not everyone has a choice. Using powerful communications satellites in the 1980s and, later, unbridled capital, transnational corporations such as McDonald's and Nike and their media-mogul counterparts have infiltrated cultures from Paris to Beijing, understanding perfectly that what the world sees the world buys (in this case, Big Macs and anything plastered with a Nike swoosh). Of course, it helps when hoops legend Michael Jordan--the world's most idolized athlete--is pitching your products. His influence is pervasive: "McDonald's, blaring Michael Jordan's endorsement, operated in 103 nations and fed one percent of the world's population each day. 'Within the East Asian urban environment,' one historian of the firm notes, 'McDonald's fills a niche once occupied by the teahouse, the neighborhood shop, the street-side stall, and the park bench.'"<p> LaFeber transitions smoothly from Michael Jordan biography to socioeconomic commentary, first exploring Jordan as the great American hero, then turning a critical eye on Nike and its shoddy overseas labor practices. Jordan can certainly sell shoes, but at what cost? In the final chapter heading, LaFeber asks whether Michael Jordan is the "Greatest Endorser of the Twentieth Century" or "An Insidious Form of Imperialism." He presents evidence of both, but ultimately <i>The New Global Capitalism</i> becomes less about Jordan's marketing prowess than America's influence over the world's consumer habits, and, subsequently, the havoc that power can wreak. LaFeber's short (164 pages), lucid study gives readers a fresh perspective on the battle between capital and culture.

That squirrels control their body temperature with their tails? That most squirrels have yellow-tinted eye lenses that work like sunglasses to reduce glare? That tree squirrels can turn their hind feet completely around when climbing down a tree head-first? In <i>Squirrels: The Animal Answer Guide,</i> Richard W. Thorington Jr. and Katie Ferrell unveil the fascinating world of one of the "most watched" mammals on the planet. </p><p>The diversity of squirrels is astounding. There are 278 species that inhabit all continents except Antarctica and Australia&#x2015;varying in size from the lumbering 18-pound gray marmot to the graceful pygmy flying squirrel that is smaller than most mice. In many parts of the world they readily share human habitats, joining us for lunch in a city park, raiding our bird feeders, and sneaking into college dorm rooms through open windows. Reviled as pests or loved as an endearing amusement, squirrels have played important roles in trade, literature, and mythology. </p><p>Thorington and Ferrell cover every aspect of this diverse animal family, from the first squirrels of 36 million years ago to the present day.

Though profitable, this role made Vig�e Le Brun a public and controversial figure, and in 1789 it precipitated her exile. In a Europe torn by strife and revolution, she nevertheless managed to thrive as an independent, self-supporting artist, doggedly setting up studios in Rome, Naples, Venice, Milan, Vienna, St. Petersburg, and London. Long overlooked or dismissed, Vig�e Le Brun&#x2019;s portraits now hang in the Louvre, in a room of their own, as well as in all leading art museums of the world.</p><p><br>This gripping biography tells the story of a singularly gifted and high-spirited woman during the revolutionary era and explores the development and significance of her art. The book also recounts the public and private lives of Elisabeth Vig�e Le Brun, connecting&nbsp; her with such personalities of her age as Catherine the Great, Napoleon, and Benjamin Franklin, and setting her experiences in the context of contemporary European politics and culture. A generous selection of illustrations, including sixteen of Vig�e Le Brun&#x2019;s portraits presented in full color, completes this exceptional volume.</p></p><p><p><b>Gita May</b> is professor of French literature, Columbia University. She has taught and published extensively on late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century French literature, art, and culture.</p>*Starred Review* In a biography as entrancing as its impressive subject, May chronicles the life story of a French woman artist who overcame the entrenched misogyny and bloody upheavals of her time to become the portraitist of choice for Europe's most powerful rulers. Elisabeth Vigee Le Brun (1755-1842) was blessed not only with talent but also with beauty, poise, and pragmatism. Already earning a good living with her luminous portraits--she was particularly adept at capturing the radiance of women and girls--Vigee Le Brun was reluctant to marry, and sure enough, her husband squandered her fortune. Vigee Le Brun was forced to flee Paris after the French Revolution, but she turned exile into a grand tour of Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia, and England as she was warmly welcomed everywhere she went and given plum commissions. Fearless, inquisitive, and clear-eyed, Vigee Le Brun climbed Mount Vesuvius, painted Catherine the Great, and hid her diamonds in her stockings, eventually returning to France in triumph. Like her irresistible subject, May is a superb portraitist, rendering with a rich palette and a light touch the exhilarating life of a remarkable artist and human being. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

That makes philosophy a 'handmaid of faith, ' yet rather than reduce its stature, offers ways of extending its tentative explorations.

He examines the fundamental principles of consequence, logical truth and correct inference within the context of logic, and shows that the principles by which we delineate consequences are themselves not guaranteed free from error. Central to the notion of truth is the beguiling issue of paradox. Its philosophical value, Read shows, lies in exposing the invalid assumption on which the paradox is built. <em>Thinking About Logic</em> also discusses logical puzzles which introduce questions relating to language, the world, and their relationship.<br></p><p>Stephen Read is Head, School of Philosophical and Anthropological Studies.<br>"...intelligent, informed, and provocative.....this is a worthy book.

With the Surete s top sleuth vying against him, Rouletabille is determined to prove only he can solve the case. This classic work of French detective fiction was much admired by Agatha Christie.

He names this system Economic Democracy, a successor-system to capitalism which preserves the efficiency strengths of a market economy while extending democracy to the workplace and to the structures of investment finance. Drawing on both theoretical and empirical research, Schweickart shows how and why this model is efficient, dynamic, and superior to capitalism along a range of values.</p><p>David Schweickart is professor of philosophy at the Loyola University of Chicago and holds Ph.D.s in both philosophy and mathematics. He is author of Against Capitalism (Cambridge University Press, 1993) and Capitalism or Worker Control? An Ethical Economic Appraisal (Praeger, 1980), and co-author of Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists (Routledge, 1998).Only the most fanatical adherents of the 'free market' orthodoxy will now say that 'there is no alternative.' <i>After Capitalism</i> is extremely clear and free of technical jargon so that it should be readily accessible to any reader. The book seems to me to be the best celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Communist Manifesto. (Schmitt, Richard)<br><br>Many book-cover blurbs urge that no one interested in its field can afford to ignore the pages within: here, for once, there would be no element of exaggeration. This book provides a clear and persuasive argument for why practically no one should resign themselves to the evils of capitalism. (<i>Philosophy In Review</i>)<br><br>At a time when American-style capitalism appears to be unassailable, this very readable book is a timely reminder that there really <i>is</i> an alternative. <i>After Capitalism</i> is full of hope but, importantly, also full of reason. Schweickart's concept of Economic Democracy provides a compelling vision for everyone distressed by the enormous waste of human potential that characterizes capitalism as we know it. (Thomas E. Weisskopf)<br><br>This brilliant and elegant <i>tour de force</i> makes a clear and compelling case for economic democracy and confirms David Schweickart as the leader in the field. (Sheehan, Thomas)<br><br>A fresh take on a familiar argument. (<i>Future Survey</i>)<br><br>David Schweickart uniquely joins a devastating critique of capitalism with a practical program for a democratic alternative, making <i>After Capitalism</i> a worthy successor to the work of Karl Marx. No one interested in implementing an alternative to capitalism can afford to ignore this landmark work. (Manley, John F.)<br><br><i>After Capitalism</i> makes the clearest case I have seen that capitalism leads nowhere but to moral, social, and environmental catastrophe. Yet it inspires hope by describing a realistic and sensible way to put our productive lives in our own hands instead of at the service of capital accumulation. Schweickart's accessible book will enlighten students and political activists about how the world works while opening new paths for its transformation. (Clayton Morgareidge)<br><br>If a well-read non-socialist leftist were to ask me for the best current book on socialism, I'd recommend <i>After Capitalism</i>.

Despite this, existing finance textbooks continue to rely heavily on hand calculators. Business school students whose background in Excel software is often weak when they come into finance courses find that when they leave the academic environment they have to relearn both finance and the software. Addressing this issue, <em>Principles of Finance with Excel</em> is the only introductory finance text that comprehensively integrates the program into the teaching and practice of finance. Offering exceptional resources for students and instructors, the book combines classroom tested pedagogy with the powerful functions of Excel software. Author Simon Benninga one of the most recognized names in financial modeling shows students how spreadsheets provide new and deeper insights into financial decision making.<br><br>The second edition of <em>Principles of Finance with Excel </em>covers the same topics as standard financial textbooks including portfolios, capital asset pricing models, stock and bond valuation, capital structure and dividend policy, and option pricing and can therefore be used in any introductory course. However, it also introduces Excel software as it applies to finance students and practitioners. Throughout the book, the implementation of finance concepts with Excel software is demonstrated and explained. A separate section of PFE provides thorough coverage of all Excel software topics used in the book: graphs, function data tables, dates, Goal Seek, and Solver.</p><p><br><strong>Simon Benninga</strong> is Professor of Finance at Tel Aviv University and Visiting Professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. His books on financial modeling and valuation are standards in the field of finance and have been translated into Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Polish, and Italian.<br><br>"<em>Principles of Finance with Excel</em> is simply the best book available for teaching financial principles using Excel. Its main competitors don't even come close."--Steve Slezak, <em>Cal Poly</em><p></p><br>"I use <em>Principles of Finance with Excel</em> because I am really convinced that Excel is an extraordinary tool to teach finance.

Tim Reid and Tom Dreesen polished their act in the nightclubs of Chicago, then took it on the road, not only in the North, but in the still-simmering South as well, developing routines that even today remain surprisingly frank--and remarkably funny--about race. Most nights, the shock of seeing an integrated comedy team quickly dissipated in uproarious laughter, but on some occasions the audience&#x2019;s confusion and discomfort led to racist heckling, threats, and even violence. Though Tim and Tom perpetually seemed on the verge of making it big throughout their five years together, they grudgingly came to realize that they were ahead of their time: America was not yet ready to laugh at its own failed promise.<br>Eventually, the grind of the road took its toll, as bitter arguments led to an acrimonious breakup. But the underlying bond of friendship Reid and Dreesen had forged with each groundbreaking joke has endured for decades, while their solo careers delivered the success that had eluded them as a team. By turns revealing, shocking, and riotously funny, <i>Tim and Tom</i> unearths a largely forgotten chapter in the history of comedy.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Tim Reid</b> is an actor, producer, and director who has created and starred in many movies and television shows, including <i>WKRP in Cincinnati,</i> in which he played the overnight disk jockey Venus Flytrap, and <i>Frank&#x2019;s Place</i>. <b>Tom Dreesen </b>is a stand-up comedian who has appeared scores of times on <i>The Tonight Show, Late Show with David Letterman</i>, and other television shows.

One story about Tom Dreesen, a man consumed by a goal and a great witness to a bygone era of show business that one can&#x2019;t help but long for. A third story about seeking recognition in the world of entertainment. And finally, a story about race and culture in a country that should have been farther down the road to understanding, tolerance and human kindness than it was in the 1970s. <i>Tim and Tom</i> is a great story, the best kind of story, well told, about two men struggling to prove themselves.

Written in the immediate aftermath of the French Revolution, it exemplifies the political optimism felt by many writers and intellectuals. Godwin drew on enlightenment ideas and his background in religious dissent for the principles of justice, utility, and the sanctity of individual judgement that drove his powerful critique of all forms of secular and religious authority. He predicts the triumph of justice and equality over injustice, and of mind over matter, and the eventual vanquishing of human frailty and mortality. He also foresees the gradual elimination of practices governing property, punishment, law, and marriage and the displacement of politics by an expanded personal morality resulting from reasoned argument and candid discussion. <em>Political Justice</em> raises deep philosophical questions about the nature of our duty to others that remain central to modern debates on ethics and politics.<br><br>This edition reprints the first-edition text of 1793, and examines Godwin's evolving philosophy in the context of his life and work.<br><br><strong>About the Series</strong>: For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

This paperback includes a new preface from the author.</strong></p><p>Whether we're buying a pair of jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier, applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401(k), everyday decisions&#x2014;both big and small&#x2014;have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented.</p><p>As Americans, we assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression.</p><p>In <em>The Paradox of Choice</em>, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice&#x2014;the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish&#x2014;becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice&#x2014;from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs&#x2014;has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse.</p><p>By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counter intuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on those that are important and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;Absorbing, witty, and persuasive.&#x201d;&#x2014;BusinessWeek Top 10 Business Books of 2004</p><p>&#x201c;Brilliant. . . .

Villagers lied, covered up, procrastinated and concealed, but most importantly they welcomed.<br><p>This is the story of an isolated community in the upper reaches of the Loire Valley that conspired to save the lives of 3,500 Jews under the noses of the Germans and the soldiers of Vichy France. It is the story of a pacifist Protestant pastor who broke laws and defied orders to protect the lives of total strangers. It is the story of an eighteen-year-old Jewish boy from Nice who forged 5,000 sets of false identity papers to save other Jews and French Resistance fighters from the Nazi concentration camps. And it is the story of a community of good men and women who offered sanctuary, kindness, solidarity and hospitality to people in desperate need, knowing full well the consequences to themselves.</p> Powerful and richly told, <em>A Good Place to Hide</em> speaks to the goodness and courage of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. 8 pages of B&amp;W illustrations</p><p>It may sound a little odd suggesting that you should enjoy this book, After all, the story takes place amidst the horrors of life in France after defeat and German Occupation. But please don't shy away because you are afraid of yet another relentless tale of misery. My interest in this story has always focussed on the drama of the situation. I write in a conversational style, so you'll find plenty of lighter moments. One reviewer wrote: "&nbsp;<i>A Good Place To Hide</i>&nbsp;combines solid historical research with the tension of a spy novel." Thank you&nbsp;<i>Shelf Awareness</i>, that's exactly what I was aiming for.&nbsp; The story is largely unknown because the participants got into such a habit of secrecy that they found it difficult to come out into the open after the war, even though the danger had passed. Let me tell you a story. If you read the book, you'll get to know a Protestant schoolgirl Catherine Cambess�d�s, who ran suitcases full of money and other supplies for the French Resistance. She risked her life doing it. You'll also meet Nelly Trocm�, the oldest daughter of the pacifist pastor Andr� Trocm�, who inspired so much of the rescue operation that is the subject of the book. Catherine and Nelly were best friends at school, and they stayed in touch after the war. They both moved to the United States, they both married, and they both had children. Nelly suggested that I go and talk to Catherine when I was researching the book, which is how I first met her.&nbsp; Teenage school friendships are pretty close, full of shared secrets. Yet Nelly found out about Catherine's wartime Resistance activities&nbsp;<i>only when she read my book, 70 years later</i>. That's how closely wartime secrets were guarded in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon and the surrounding villages.&nbsp; My first two books were set in Australia during World War 2. The first dealt with the Japanese midget submarine raid on Sydney Harbour on 31 May 1942. The second dealt with the Japanese bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942. Both battles were military fiascos. Australia was unprepared. Her soldiers and sailors were under-trained, poorly equipped and badly led. Very different books from&nbsp;<i>A Good Place To Hide</i>, you might think. But to me all three books are inspired by the same thought: these are dramatic&nbsp;<i>stories</i>, and my interest has always been in a dramatic narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you decide to read&nbsp;<i>A Good Place To Hide</i>&nbsp;and are surprised to find yourself in the midst of an exotic cast list -- a teenage Jewish typewriter repairman who became a master forger; a female American spy with a wooden leg, which she called Cuthbert; the novelist Albert Camus working on the first draft of his masterpiece&nbsp;<i>La Peste</i>&nbsp;("The Plague"); an unswerving pacifist pastor who was awarded the Medal of the Resistance with Rosette, a rare French military distinction -- then I can only apologise for startling you, and make a plea in mitigation that I find it hard to resist anything that makes for a good story.Nobody asked questions, nobody demanded money. Villagers lied, covered up, procrastinated and concealed, but most importantly they welcomed.This is the story of an isolated community in the upper reaches of the Loire Valley that conspired to save the lives of 3,500 Jews under the noses of the Germans and the soldiers of Vichy France.

"The most important thing we learned was that psychology was half-baked, literally half-baked," he said. "We've baked the part about mental illness, about repair of damage. The other side's unbaked, the side of strength, the side of what we're good at."</p><p>More recently, some might even point to the book I wrote with Donald Clifton for the Gallup organization, <i>Now, Discover Your Strengths</i>, which began with this optimistic statement of intent: "We wrote this book to start a revolution, the strengths revolution."</p><p>Whatever its true source, the strengths movement is now in full flood. It is a wave of change that, over the last several years, has swept us all forward. No discipline has been left behind. Whether we work in business, government, education, or health care, this wave has lifted us up, spun us around, and revealed to us all a new world. You may not yet recognize the change -- some of us were bowled over by the wave, while others barely noticed it carrying them along. But, with or without our knowledge, it has picked us up and deposited us far from where we were a decade ago. And there's no going back. This wave has forever changed the way we perceive ourselves, our employees, our students, and our children.</p><p>Look around you, and you'll see clearly the signs of change.</p><p>Many of the world's most successful organizations such as Wells Fargo, Intel, Best Buy, and Accenture have declared their commitment to becoming an explicitly strengths-based organization. All new managers at Toyota must now attend a three-day Great Manager training program that shows them how to spot the strengths of their subordinates. All new managers at Yahoo are required to take an online survey that measures their talents and pinpoints their strongest.</p><p>Look beyond business, and you'll see nonprofit organizations such as the U.S. Coast Guard, the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma, the American Society on Aging, and the New Zealand Ministry of Youth Development all installing similar strengths-based programs and initiatives.</p><p>Universities too have been swept up by the movement. Princeton, with great fanfare, recently set up its own Center for Health and Well-Being, dedicated to the study of all that is right in the world. Over half the faculty are, surprisingly, economists. At Harvard, Professor Tal David Ben-Shahar's class An Introduction to Positive Psychology is now the most popular elective class in the entire curriculum. And Azusa Pacific University now has a Center for Strengths-Based Education, set up by the pioneering educator Edward "Chip" Anderson.</p><p>Look further still, and you'll see more signs of the movement's reach. If your child happens to break the law in Ingham County, Michigan, before his day in probate court, he'll be asked to fill out a Strengths Assessment for Juvenile Justice, which will pose strengths-based questions such as "Have you made any good changes in the past? How did you make these changes?" and "What is your first step to get out of this trouble? Who will be the first person to notice this step?"</p><p>If you are a psychiatry student learning to work with patients suffering persistent mental disorders, you will be asked to read Charles Rapp's 1997 classic, <i>The Strengths Model</i>, which shows you, case by case, how to "amplify the well part of the patient."</p><p>If you are an aspiring soccer coach, Major League Soccer will be happy to sign you up for its Strengths-Based Coaching course. Here you'll learn, among other things, how to hand out "green cards," which draw a child's attention to a particularly good pass or tackle he made, rather than the traditionally punitive yellow and red cards.</p><p>Today the strengths movement is everywhere: the corporate world, the worlds of public service, of economics, of education, of faith, of charity -- it has affected them all. It has its detractors, of course, but an appeal as universal as this begs the question "Why?" Why do so many people from so many different worlds see such power in the strengths-based perspective?</p><p>Because it works better than any other perspective. The radical idea at the core of the strengths movement is that excellence is not the opposite of failure, and that, as such, you will learn little about excellence from studying failure. This seems like an obvious idea until you realize that, before the strengths movement began, virtually all business and academic inquiry was built on the opposite idea: namely, that a deep understanding of failure leads to an equally deep understanding of excellence. That's why we studied unhappy customers to learn about the happy ones, employees' weaknesses to learn how to make them excel, sickness to learn about health, divorce to learn about marriage, and sadness to learn about joy.</p><p>What has become evident in virtually every field of human endeavor is that failure and success are not opposites, they are merely different, and so they must be studied separately. Thus, for example, if you want to learn what you should <i>not</i> do after an environmental disaster, Chernobyl will be instructive. But if you want to learn what you <i>should</i> do, Chernobyl is a waste. Only successful cleanups, such as at the Rocky Flats nuclear facility in Colorado, can tell you what excellence looks like.</p><p>Study unproductive teams, and you soon discover that the teammates argue a lot. Study successful teams, and you learn that they argue just as much. To find the secrets to a great team, you have to investigate the successful ones and figure out what is going on in the space between the arguments.</p><p>Focus your research on people who contract HIV and die, and you gain some useful insights about how the disease wrecks the body's immune system. But focus your research on those few people with HIV who are relatively unaffected by the disease, and you learn something else entirely: namely, how the body fights back.</p><p>Conventional wisdom tells us that we learn from our mistakes. The strengths movement says that all we learn from mistakes are the characteristics of mistakes. If we want to learn about our successes, we must study successes.</p><p>Fueled by this idea, the first stage of the strengths movement -- the stage we are in right now -- has been dominated by efforts to label what is right with things. Thus, whereas the World Bank used to rank countries according to their negative qualities, such as poverty, violence, and vulnerability, today it has developed a list of positive labels that capture a country's overall level of well-being, labels such as social capability, economic self-determination, and sustainability of local customs.</p><p>In the field of psychology, our descriptors all used to be heavily skewed toward the negatives: neurotic, psychotic, schizophrenic, depressed. Today we have redressed the balance and have added equally detailed labels to describe the positives. For example, Martin Seligman and his colleague Chris Peterson have developed their list of "Character Strengths and Virtues," which includes such qualities as Courage, Justice, Transcendence, and Temperance.</p><p>Similarly, <i>Now, Discover Your Strengths</i> introduced Gallup's online personality profile called StrengthsFinder (since renamed the Clifton StrengthsFinder, in Don's memory), which measures you on thirty-four themes of talent, with names like Ideation, Restorative, Significance, and Connectedness.</p><p>Our hunger for these labels can be measured in part by the number of people who have taken the Clifton StrengthsFinder profile since 2001. The total is now over two million. More revealing still, each year this number not only increases, but the <i>increase</i> increases. More people took it last year than the year before, and more the year before than the year before that. Clearly, millions of us feel a deep need to label what's right with us.</p><p><b>THE SECOND STAGE: HOW TO TAKE ACTION</b></p><p>If all this labeling is to not go to waste, however, we must now take the necessary next step. We must progress into the second stage of the strengths movement: the action stage. This is where we learn how to go beyond the affirming power of a label. It's the stage where we engage with the real world, where we figure out how to use our strengths to make a tangible contribution, where we deal with people who don't agree on what our strengths are, or who don't care, or who do care but want us to focus them differently than we do. It's the stage where we step up and put our strengths to work.</p><p>This book leads us into the second stage, where the real payoff is to be found.</p><p>While the labeling stage was driven by the theoretical idea that you learn little about excellence from studying failure, the action stage is founded on a more pragmatic premise: namely, that a person or an organization will excel only by amplifying strengths, never by simply fixing weaknesses.</p><p>At the level of the organization, this premise has been both widely disseminated and well executed. Drawing on the economic theories of the eighteenth-century economist David Riccardo, Peter Drucker wrote that the most competitive companies, just like the most competitive countries, "get their strengths together and make their weaknesses irrelevant." Jim Collins in his book <i>Good to Great</i> captured the same idea when he wrote that great companies focus on those few things they can b...</p></p><h2>The Art of Being Human: The Humanities as a Technique for Living (10th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>The Art of Being Human, Tenth Edition,</i> </b> <b> introduces students to the ways in which the humanities can broaden their perspectives, enhance their ability to think critically, and enrich their lives.</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This well-respected book has been lauded for its scope, accessibility, and writing style.&nbsp; Featuring a unique topical organization, Part I introduces the humanities as a technique for living, by connecting the arts to students&#x2019; daily lives, utilizing the humanities to foster critical thinking skills, and examining their mythic origins.&nbsp; Part II explores the individual genres of literature, art, music, theater, musical theater, and cinema.&nbsp; Part III looks at provocative themes in the humanities: religion, morality, happiness, love, life and death, nature, and freedom.</p> <br></p><p></p><h2>The Police in America: An Introduction</h2><p><i>The Police in America</i> provides a comprehensive introduction to the foundations of policing in the United States today.

Thompson, and Me</h2><p>In the spring of 1970, artist Ralph Steadman went to America in search of work and found more than he bargained for when he met Hunter S. Thompson at the Kentucky Derby. Their remarkable collaboration resulted in the now-legendary Gonzo Journalism, which would document the civil rights movement, the Nixon administration, Watergate, and the many bizarre and great events that shaped the second half of the twentieth century. When Thompson committed suicide in 2005, it was the end of a unique friendship filled with both betrayal and understanding.

The poster and accompanying 48&#x2013;page paperback book sum up the mistellings&#x2014;and reveal the real story&#x2014;in a graphically appealing and accessible format that shows the degree to which textbooks have &#x201c;lied&#x201d; by knowingly substituting crowd-pleasing myths for grim and gruesome historical evidence.<br> <br></p><p><b>James W.

What if Sitting Bull had had a machine gun at Little Big Horn? What if Attila the Hun had had a time machine? What if Columbus had landed in India after all? Some of those dorm-room speculators grew up to be historians, and their generation (along with a few younger and older scholars) makes a strong showing in this anthology of essays, in which the what-ifs are substantially more plausible. What if Hitler had not attacked Russia when he did? He might have moved into the Middle East and secured the oil supplies the Third Reich so badly needed, helping it retain its power in Europe. What if D-Day had been a failure? The Soviet Union might have controlled all of Europe. What if Sennacherib had pressed the siege of Jerusalem in 701 B.C.? Then the nascent, monotheistic Jewish religion might never have taken hold among the people of Judah--and the daughter religions of Christianity and Islam would never have been born.<p> So suggest some of the many first-rate contributors to this collection, which grew from a special issue of <i>MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History</i>. One of them is classicist Josiah Ober, who suggests that if Alexander the Great had died at the age of 21 instead of 32, Greece would have been swallowed up by Persia and Rome, and the modern Western world would have a much different sensibility--and probably little idea of democratic government. Still other contributors are Stephen E. Ambrose, Caleb Carr, John Keegan, David McCullough, and James McPherson, who examine a range of scenarios populated by dozens of historical figures, including Sir Walter Raleigh, Chiang Kai-shek, Robert E. Lee, Benito Mussolini, and Themistocles. The result is a fascinating exercise in historical speculation, one that emphasizes the importance of accident and of roads not taken in the evolution of human societies across time. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Robert Cowley is the founding editor of <b>MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History</b>, which was nominated for a National Magazine Award for General Excellence.

How freely can the reader interpret it? Could a nursery rhyme like <i>Baa Baa Black Sheep</i> be full of concealed loathing, resentment, and aggression? In this accessible, delightfully entertaining book, Terry Eagleton addresses these intriguing questions and a host of others. <i>How to Read Literature </i>is the book of choice for students new to the study of literature and for all other readers interested in deepening their understanding and enriching their reading experience.</p><p>In a series of brilliant analyses, Eagleton shows how to read with due attention to tone, rhythm, texture, syntax, allusion, ambiguity, and other formal aspects of literary works. He also examines broader questions of character, plot, narrative, the creative imagination, the meaning of fictionality, and the tension between what works of literature say and what they show. Unfailingly authoritative and cheerfully opinionated, the author provides useful commentaries on classicism, Romanticism, modernism, and postmodernism along with spellbinding insights into a huge range of authors, from Shakespeare and J. K. Rowling to Jane Austen and Samuel Beckett.</p></p><p><p>In this delightfully entertaining guide, an eminent critic explains with abundant examples everything you need to know to read literary works with deeper insight, better understanding, and much more enjoyment.</p><b>Terry Eagleton</b> is Distinguished Professor of Literature, University of Lancaster, UK, and Excellence in English Distinguished Visiting Professor, University of Notre Dame.

Offering insights into the complex dynamics of the ethnically Tibetan enclave of Nubri, Childs provides a vivid and compelling portrait of the ebb and flow of life and death, of communal harmony and discord, and of personal conflicts and social resolutions. Part ethnography, part travelogue, and part biography, <i>Tibetan Diary </i>is a one-of-a-kind book that conveys the tangled intricacies of a Tibetan society.<br><br>Childs's immensely readable and informative narrative incorporates contemporary observations as well as vignettes culled from first-person testaments including oral histories and autobiographies. Examining the tensions between cultural ideals and individual aspirations, he explores certain junctures in the course of life: how the desire to attain religious knowledge or to secure a caretaker in old age contrasts with social expectations and familial obligation, for example. The result is a vivid and unparalleled view of the quest for both spiritual meaning and mundane survival that typifies life in an unpredictable Himalayan environment.</p><p>"An immensely engaging work that contributes much to our understanding of the social-religious culture of Tibetan village life at the local level, providing a rich and deeply personal account of the ebb and flow of life and death, of communal harmony and discord, of personal conflicts and social resolutions. The author shows that the Himalayan enclaves of Nubri and Kutang are genuinely human communities with their own complications and contradictions."&#x2014;Bryan J. Cuevas, author of <i>The Hidden History of the Tibetan Book of the Dead</i><br><br>"An immensely readable and genuinely moving account of Tibetan lives and religion. Childs provides mutually illuminating narratives of the present and past that reveal an intimate portrayal of a Tibetan community in the Nepalese highlands."&#x2014;David Germano, University of Virginia<br><br>"A splendid book that displays a remarkable ability to combine a critical understanding of the difficulties of Tibetan life with a great sensitivity to its humane atmosphere and its cultural complexities. This rich anthropological study is also a good read that conveys valuable insights through an entertaining and at times moving narrative. In short, a must read for all those who love Tibetans and their culture, as well as a most welcome addition to the developing field of Tibetan anthropology."&#x2014;Georges Dreyfus, Professor of Religion, Williams College, author of <i>The Sound of Two Hands Clapping: The Education of a Tibetan Buddhist Monk</i><b>Geoff Childs </b>is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Washington University.</p><h2>Religion and Devotion in Europe, c.1215&#x2013; c.1515 (Cambridge Medieval Textbooks)</h2><p>This is the first one-volume survey in English of religion and devotion in Europe between 1215 and 1515. Intended primarily as a student textbook, it provides essential background for a proper appreciation of medieval Western society. Avoiding the history of institutional structures, the book concentrates on the spirituality that the medieval Church sought to promulgate and control. Its thematic structure provides accessible surveys of major themes, and addresses recent debates about key aspects of medieval Catholicism.</p><p>The first one-volume survey in English of medieval religion and devotion concentrates on the spirituality that the church sought to promulgate and control.

Brundage, History</p><h2>The Broadview Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Verse and Prose (Broadview Anthologies of English Literature)</h2><p><p> The publication of <em>The Broadview Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Verse and Prose</em> is a literary event; this comprehensive volume is the first anthology of the period to reflect the breadth of seventeenth-century studies in recent decades. Over one hundred writers are included, from John Chamberlain at the beginning of the century to Elisabeth Singer Rowe at its end. There are generous selections from the work of all major writers, and a representation of the work of virtually every writer of significance. The work of women writers figures prominently, with extensive selections not only from canonical writers such as Behn and Bradstreet, but also from other writers (such as Katherine Philips and Margaret Cavendish) who have been receiving considerable scholarly attention in recent years. </p> <p> The anthology is broadly inclusive, with writing from America as well as from the British Isles. Memoirs, letters, political texts, travel writing, prophetic literature, street ballads, and pamphlet literature are all here, as is a full representation of the literary poetry and prose of the period, including the poetry of Jonson; the prose of Bacon; the metaphysical poetry of Donne, Herbert, Marvell, and others; the lyric verse of Herrick; and substantial selections from the poetry and prose of Milton and Dryden. (While <em>Samson Agonistes</em> is included in its entirety, Milton&#x2019;s epic poems have been excluded, in order to allow space for other works not so readily accessible elsewhere.) </p> <p> The editors have included complete works wherever possible. A headnote by the editors introduces each author, and each selection has been newly annotated. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Alan Rudrum</strong>, a Professor Emeritus of English Literature at Simon Fraser University and the anthology&#x2019;s senior editor, has published extensively on seventeenth-century British literature. </p> <p> <strong>Joseph Black</strong>, an Associate Professor in the English Department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has published articles on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century British literature and book history. </p> <p> <strong>Holly Faith Nelson</strong>, who recently obtained her doctorate from Simon Fraser University, is a Lecturer at Trinity Western University. </p><p> &#x201c;There are many good things to be said about <em>The Broadview Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Verse and Prose</em>&#x2015;not least that it comes to help relieve a quarter-of-a-century&#x2019;s dearth of decent anthologies, that it covers the whole century, and that it includes a number of women writers...This ambitious and thoughtful anthology deserves a large audience.&#x201d; &#x2015; Tom Clayton, Regents Professor of English, University of Minnesota </p></p><h2>Your Painting Questions Answered from A to Z</h2><p>The major bulk of Helen Van Wyk's illustrious career was devoted to teaching others the principles and fundamentals of painting. Consequently, her students came away from her classes with a profound understanding of the elements that made their paintings look credible. Many of her students went on to teach in their own right, just as Helen had done at the age of eighteen when she came out from under the protective (and critical) wing of her mentor, M. A. Rasko. And now, we have compiled the most-asked questions by students of Helen's over her forty-year teaching career.<br>Some of the questions you will find answers to: How are reflections in water and tables painted? How is a background painted smoothly? Why shouldn't I use black? What are the many oil painting mediums? When are they used? How did the Old Masters use glazes? What are the most common mistakes in composition? How can I make a copy that's exactly like a photo or painting? What colors would I need to paint white subjects? How can I paint textures that are shiny and dull?</p><p></p><h2>Desire and Domestic Fiction: A Political History of the Novel</h2><p><em>Desire and Domestic Fiction</em> argues that far from being removed from historical events, novels by writers from Richardson to Woolf were themselves agents of the rise of the middle class. Drawing on texts that range from 18th-century female conduct books and contract theory to modern psychoanalytic case histories and theories of reading, Armstrong shows that the emergence of a particular form of female subjectivity capable of reigning over the household paved the way for the establishment of institutions which today are accepted centers of political power. Neither passive subjects nor embattled rebels, the middle-class women who were authors and subjects of the major tradition of British fiction were among the forgers of a new form of power that worked in, and through, their writing to replace prevailing notions of "identity" with a gender-determined subjectivity. Examining the works of such novelists as Samuel Richardson, Jane Austen, and the Bront�s, she reveals the ways in which these authors rewrite the domestic practices and sexual relations of the past to create the historical context through which modern institutional power would seem not only natural but also humane, and therefore to be desired.<br></p><p>Nancy Armstrong is at University of Minnesota.<br>"A very interesting look at the relationship between our political system and the novel--it should prove to be a springboard for class discussion."--Robert W. Langran, <em>Villanova University</em><p></p><br>"The provocative thesis Armstrong develops challenges traditional descriptions of the rise of the novel by locating the essential force of the 18th century's new fiction in the domestic novel depicting the household as a center of female power....A genuine contribution to the growing shelf of feminist criticism."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"A work of considerable intelligence and insight."--<em>South Atlantic Review</em><p></p><br>"This is the first book-length study to bring the insights of Michel Foucault to bear upon the subject of women and literature, and the resulting innovations are important and salutary....Her book provides a challenging revision of the history of the novel. Moreover, it entirely reassesses the roles played by both novels and women in the making of modern culture."--<em>Victorian Studies</em><p></p><br>"A bold and original book....It is nothing less than a radical reinterpretation of the rise of the novel in England which simultaneously overturns...not only the established view issuing from Ian Watt, but also recently entrenched feminist readings.... It is a work with a powerful thesis and will have to be reckoned with by anyone concerned with feminism, the theory of fiction, or the rise to hegemony of the English middle class."--Allon White, <em>University of Sussex</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Ortho&#39;s All About Creating Japanese Gardens</h2><p>These days, people crave gardens that fill the soul and comfort the body.

Instead, the cultured Shimerda family finds itself huddled in a primitive sod house buffeted by the ceaselessly blowing winds on the Midwest prairie. For her childhood friend Jim Burden, �ntonia comes to embody the elemental spirit of this frontier. Working alongside men, she survives without compromising the rich, deep power of her nature. And Willa Cather&#x2019;s lush descriptions of the rolling Nebraska grasslands interweave with the blossoming of a woman in the early days of the twentieth century in a novel that is an epic chronicle of America&#x2019;s past. The novel Cather herself considered her best, <i>My �ntonia</i> is one of those rare, highly prized works of great literature that not only enriches its readers but immerses them in a tale superbly told.<br><br> <b>With an Introduction by Marilyn Sides<br> and an Afterword by Terese Svoboda</b></p><p>It seems almost sacrilege to infringe upon a book as soulful and rich as Willa Cather's <i>My �ntonia</i> by offering comment. First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

It is an intimate epic, an excavation of the self, and a comedy of manners by turns and all at once. Proust is the twentieth century&#39;s Dante, presenting us with a unique, unsettling picture of ourselves as jealous lovers and unmitigated snobs, frittering our lives away, with only the hope of art as a possible salvation. He offers us a form of redemption for a sober and secular age. Scott Moncrieff&#39;s delightful translation was for many years the only access to Proust in English. A labour of love that took him nearly as many years as Proust spent writing the original. Moncrieff&#39;s translation strives to capture the extraordinary blend of muscular analysis with poetic reverie that typifies Proust&#39;s style. It remains a justly famous classic of translation.</p><p>Valentin Louis Georges Eug�ne Marcel Proust (10 July 1871 &#x2013; 18 November 1922) was a French novelist, critic, and essayist best known for his monumental novel � la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time; earlier rendered as Remembrance of Things Past), published in seven parts between 1913 and 1927. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest authors.A beautiful, atmospheric, and nostalgic work, Swann's Way is highly recommended for literary connoisseurs and public library audiobook collections. - --Library Bookwatch<br><br>And so it begins, it all begins yet again: Marcel Proust's inimitable and magnificent <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, probably the greatest of literary works of all time. Neville Jason has taken on the titanic task of reading the whole unabridged seven volumes for Naxos AudioBooks in a new and updated translation which simply means that no other reader can get close to him in his subtle and unique understanding of Proust. <i>Swann's Way</i> is perhaps the most fondly nostalgic of the seven novels and the inimitable descriptions of Marcel's youth are almost unbearable in their fantastic attention to detail. The village of Combray where the family holidayed is also a fantastic recreation of a past which is now gone and which will simply never return. Jason's reading is assured and full of style and a classic poise which makes him the ideal Proust reader. One waits with trepidation and eager anticipation for the next volume in this wonderful series. --Gerald Fenech, Malta News Online<br><br>As regular readers of <i>Kirkville</i> probably know, I'm a fan of Marcel Proust. I recently started re-reading <i>A la recherche du temps perdu</i>, but was sidetracked by moving house. Some time ago, I listened to the entire work, on a French audio recording. But not all Proustians are French speakers. Proust actually has quite a following in the US and England, and his popularity is such that Naxos AudioBooks has recently released the first part of a complete, unabridged recording of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i> (also known as <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>). The narrator, Neville Jason, has one of those smooth, soft English accents that lulls and entrances you. His reading is leisurely and relaxed. He takes his time, allowing you to absorb the work comfortably, without speaking too slowly, as is sometimes the case on older audiobook readings. Jason's reading is a performance, but it also sounds like he's sitting by your side, reading from the book, like a friend. In addition, his French accent is quite good, and when he speaks the names of French people or towns, it sounds as it should. <i>Swann s Way</i> is more than 21 hours long, and is only the first of seven volumes of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>. Naxos AudioBooks will be releasing each volume individually, and will most likely offer a box set with the entire text - which will be more than 120 hours - when all the titles have been released. If you want to listen to Proust, and don't speak French, Neville Jason's recordings are excellent. For now, this is the only complete recording in the works. Simon Vance, who is also another wonderful narrator, has recorded <i>Swann's Way</i>, but it doesn t look like this will be a complete recording of all seven volumes of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, as this recording was released in September, 2010, and no follow-up has yet been released. --Kirk McElhearn, Kirkville<br><br>Naxos, the renowned producer of classical music recordings, is publishing a complete and unabridged recording of Marcel Proust's epic work, <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i> (<i>� la Recherche du Temps Perdu</i>). The reader is Neville Jason, who the <i>Washington Post</i> called 'the marathon man' after his 70 hour recording of Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace</i>. Jason is well equipped to read this even longer work by Proust, having received the Sir John Gielgud prize for fiction while he was at RADA and having then gone on to perform with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Old Vic Company. Indeed, while reading an earlier abridged version of Proust, he did the abridgement himself and also translated the final volume (see article in AudioFile Magazine). The first volume al --Tom Cunliffe, A Common Reader<br><br>All seven volumes of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, of which this is the first, represent a staggering recording feat: 150 hours of unabridged Proust read by 78-year-old Neville Jason.

For us Jason's voice is the magic cord that draws us inexorably in. --Rachel Redford, The Oldie</p><h2>Affirming Diversity: The Sociopolitical Context of Multicultural Education</h2><p>In this fifth edition of her best-selling book Affirming Diversity: The Sociopolitical Context of Multicultural Education, renowned scholar Sonia Nieto explores the meaning, necessity, and benefits of multicultural education for students of all backgrounds.

From his early life in Vienna as a member of Freud&#39;s innermost circle, to his break with psychoanalysis and development of a new school of thought, the compelling life and work of Alfred Adler is dramatically illuminated.</p><p>Hoffman (The Right to Be Human, 1988, etc.) throws steady, if hardly sparkling, light on a career overshadowed by Freud's. A gift for coining apt and memorable names for his governing psychological concepts--``inferiority complex,'' ``sibling rivalry''--has meant that Alfred Adler's ideas currently enjoy greater renown than the man himself. But during his lifetime, Adler's accessible approach to child psychology, education, and social adjustment found a receptive audience, especially in the US, where his optimism (``Anyone can become anything,'' he proclaimed) struck more chords than did Freud's darker vision. Much to his own frustration, Adler was popularly associated with Freudian thought, from which he in fact broke well before WW I. Like Freud, Adler was a largely assimilated Viennese Jew who died abroad in exile from a hostile political climate. His movement, ``Individual Psychology,'' emphasized individual experience (rather than the unconscious drives posited by orthodox Freudianism) and denied the fundamental importance of the libido. Furthermore, whereas for Freud our tragic dilemma was that civilization could thrive only by denying and repressing our most basic urges, Adler believed humans to be instinctively social. In his view, what inhibited social energies or diverted them into inadequacy or aggression were ``mistakes'' in early childhood that led to neurotic overcompensation for a burning sense of inferiority, mistakes that could be set right through patient attention by parents, therapists, and educators. Adler's convictions were grounded too in social democratic principles that saw individual pathologies in the context of the social and economic whole. Hoffman chronicles Adler's life and ideas dutifully, recapitulating the familiar cultural landscape of fin de si&#x160;cle Vienna and interwar America in a serviceable but rather pedestrian style marred by occasional awkwardness. A worthwhile effort, covering important ground competently. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The earliest of Freud's adherents to break away and form his own system of psychological theory, Adler is responsible for such common concepts as the inferiority complex, the importance of birth order, and the "spoiled" child. Despite the fact that his central notion-that we humans develop from an innate desire to interact with others-is far more central to contemporary psychology than is Freud's idea of libidinal drives, no major biography of Adler has been written, perhaps because he did not establish a cohesive school of followers. Unfortunately, this book does not completely fill this gap. Perhaps because Adler was a talker, not a writer, Hoffman's study does not convey much sense of the man, nor does it systematically describe his theories. Josef Rattner's Alfred Adler (LJ 5/1/83) and Manes Soerber's Masks of Loneliness: Alfred Adler in Perspective (Macmillan, 1974) both offer more complete expositions of Adler's "individual psychology" accompanied by some biographical information.

The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study. <br> North India is home to a wealth of musical traditions composed of many different styles, genres, and practices. <em>Music in North India</em> provides a representative overview of this music, discussing rhythm and drumming traditions, song composition and performance styles, and melodic and rhythmic instruments. Drawing on his experience as a sarod player, vocalist, and music teacher, author George Ruckert incorporates numerous musical exercises to demonstrate important concepts. The book ranges from the chants of the ancient Vedas to modern devotional singing and from the serious and meditative rendering of raga to the concert-hall excitement of the modern sitar, sarod, and tabla. It is framed around three major topics: the devotional component of North Indian music, the idea of fixity and spontaneity in the various styles of Indian music, and the importance of the verbal syllable to the expression of the musical aesthetic in North India. Featuring vivid eyewitness accounts of performances and descriptions of interviews with performers, <em>Music in North India</em> examines the form, structure, and expression of North Indian music while also illuminating its profound religious and cultural significance.

This debate over <i>ethics</i>, however, has sidelined important questions of literary <i>form</i>. <i>Bending Genre </i>does not ask where the boundaries between genres should be drawn, but what happens when you push the line. Written for writers and students of creative writing, this collection brings together perspectives from today's leading writers of creative nonfiction, including Michael Martone, Brenda Miller, Ander Monson, and David Shields. Each writer's innovative essay probes our notions of genre and investigates how creative nonfiction is shaped, modeling the forms of writing being discussed. Like creative nonfiction itself, <i>Bending Genre </i>is an exciting hybrid that breaks new ground.</p></p><p><p><b>Margot Singer</b> is Associate Professor of Creative Writing at Denison University in Granville, Ohio.

Brassa�'s curiosity about his subjects and the originality of his approach highlight the depth of his identification with Paris, his adopted city. The son of a professor of French literature, Brassa� had first visited the city at the age of 5; later, in the early 1920s, he returned to make it his home after completion of studies in fine art in Budapest and Berlin. Settling in the bohemian arrondissement of Montparnasse, mixing with artists and writers, Brassa� took up photography "in order to capture the beauty of streets and gardens in the rain and fog, and to capture Paris by night." He lures us into the smoky, highly charged world of clubs and caf�s, where nicotine-stained lovers in cheap clothes become impossibly desirable through the camera's lens. Streets, stairways, and canals are moodily lit; even a man rummaging for food in a rubbish bin takes on a cinematic aura. Yet Brassa�'s photographs contain a strange mixture of seediness and resilience that ultimately triumphs over any false notions of glamour. He depicts scenes of poverty and its trappings--alcoholism, prostitution, violence, hunger. The chaotic social whirl of 1930s Paris dies down to the quiet suffering of a city under occupation, with its two great literary lights, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, sitting out the war, stony-faced in the Caf� de Flore. Accompanied by extracts from Brassa�'s own writings, contemporaries such as Henry Miller, and essays from other contributors, and containing 308 images, <i>Brassa�</i> is a fine testament to an artist whose images of one city have proved so enduring. <i>--Catherine Taylor, Amazon.co.uk</i>Robert Grenier&#39;s previous books include A Box of Photographs and Brassa�: The Monograph.</p><h2>Engineering with Excel (4th Edition)</h2><p><p>For introductory courses in Engineering and Computing</p> <p>Based on�Excel 2010, <i>Engineering with Excel, 4e</i> takes a comprehensive look at using Excel in engineering.� This book focuses on applications and is intended to serve as both a textbook and a reference for students.</p></p><p><b>Ronald W.

Lib.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fragmentation and Redemption: Essays on Gender and the Human Body in Medieval Religion</h2><p><p>These seven essays by noted historian Caroline Walker Bynum exemplify her argument that historians must write in a "comic" mode, aware of history's artifice, risks, and incompletion. Exploring a diverse array of medieval texts, the essays show how women were able to appropriate dominant social symbols in ways that revised and undercut them, allowing their own creative and religious voices to emerge. Taken together, they provide a model of how to account for gender in studying medieval texts and offer a new interpretation of the role of asceticism and mysticism in Christianity. In the first three essays, Bynum focuses on the methodological problems inherent in the writing of history. She shows that a consideration of medieval texts written by women and the rituals attractive to them undermines the approaches of three 20th-century intellectual figures&#x2015;Victor Turner, Max Weber, and Leo Steinberg&#x2015;and illustrates how other disciplines can enrich historical research. These methodological considerations are then used in the next three essays to examine gender proper. While describing the "experiential" literary voices of medieval women, Bynum underlines the corporality of women's piety and focuses on both the cultural construction and the intractable physicality of the body itself. She also examines how the acts and attitudes of men affected the cultural construction of categories such as "female," "heretic," and "saint" and shows that the study of gender is the study of how roles and possibilities are conceptualized by both women and men. In the final essay, Bynum elucidates how medieval discussions of bodily resurrection and the obsession with material details enrich modem debates over questions of self-identity and survival.</p></p><p>Caroline Walker Bynum is Professor of Medieval European History, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, and University Professor Emerita at Columbia University. She is the author of<i> Fragmentation and Redemption: Essays on Gender and the Human Body in Medieval Religion</i> and <i>Metamorphosis and Identity</i>, both published by Zone Books.-- Christopher Hughes, Voice Literary Supplement<br><br>In 1188, the Benedictine monk Gervase of Canterbury wrote that, compared to the plodding chronicler, 'the historian proceeds diffusely and elegantly.' On the strength of her writing style and her sophisticated, sensitive deployment of prodigious knowledge, Caroline Bynum is surely a historian by Gervase's standards.... She provides an encouraging model for both historical endeavor and the management of an increasingly fragmented modern existence."--Christopher Hughes, Voice Literary Supplement</p><h2>Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West</h2><p><p><i>Prisoners of Shangri-La</i> is a provocative analysis of the romance of Tibet, a romance that, even as it is invoked by Tibetan lamas living in exile, ultimately imprisons those who seek the goal of Tibetan independence from Chinese occupation.<br> <br> "Lopez lifts the veil on America's romantic vision of Tibet to reveal a country and a spiritual history more complex and less ideal than popular perceptions allow. . . . Lively and engaging, Lopez's book raises important questions about how Eastern religions are often co-opted, assimilated and misunderstood by Western culture."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br> <br> "Proceeding with care and precision, Lopez reveals the extent to which scholars have behaved like intellectual colonialists. . . . Someone had to burst the bubble of pop Tibetology, and few could have done it as resoundingly as Lopez."&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br> <br> "Fascinating. . . [A] provocative exploration. Lopez conveys the full dizziness of the Western encounter with Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism."&#x2014;Fred Pheil, <i>Tricycle: The Buddhist Review</i><br> <br> "A timely and courageous exploration. . . . [Lopez's] book will sharpen the terms of the debate over what the Tibetans and their observers can or should be doing about the place and the idea of Tibet. And that alone is what will give us all back our Shambhala."&#x2014;Jonathan Spence, <i>Lingua Franca Book Review</i><br> <br> "Lopez's most important theme is that we should be wary of the idea . . . that Tibet has what the West lacks, that if we were only to look there we would find the answers to our problems. Lopez's book shows that, on the contrary, when the West has looked at Tibet, all that it has seen is a distorted reflection of itself."&#x2014;Ben Jackson, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br> <br></p></p><p>In this book, Donald Lopez provides the first cultural history of the strange encounter between Tibetan Buddhism and the West. Charting the flights of Western fantasies of Tibet and its Buddhist legacy, Lopez presents fanciful visions of Tibetan life and religion, ranging from the utopian to the demonic. He examines, among much else, the politics of the term &#34;Lamaism&#34;, a pejorative name for Tibet&#39;s religion; the various theosophical, psychedelic, and New Age purposes served by The Tibetan Book of the Dead; the strange case of the Englishman with three eyes; and the unexpected history of the most famous of all Buddhist mantras, om mani padme hum. Throughout, Lopez demonstrates how myths of Tibet pervade both the products of pop culture and learned scholarly works.<b>Donald S. Lopez Jr.</b> is the Arthur E.

As an account of a woman's struggle for survival and dignity in a distinctly male-dominated society, it contributes significantly to women's history. For observers of the black experience, it affords opinionated, but nonetheless revealing, views about African American folklife. It presents a rich portrait of a distinctive place&#x2015;the South Carolina Low Country&#x2015;in a troubled and generally undocumented time, a portrait made all the more vivid by the fine pen-and-ink sketches of Charleston artist Alice R. Huger Smith.</p><p>Elizabeth Allston Pringle grew up on the antebellum rice plantation of her father, a former South Carolina governor. Once the owner of seven plantations and 15,000 acres, her father, at the time of his death, was bankrupt. Left to struggle for income to regain the property and position the family held prior to the war, Pringle turned to writing and eventually published a column on Southern culture in the New York Sun under the pseudonym Patience Pennington. In 1913 she collected and reshaped these newspaper columns and compiled them into one volume, A Woman Rice Planter. Her descriptions of the vagaries of rice planting, of her relationships with former slaves and the first generation of free-born African Americans, and of her life in the early Reconstruction period are important to our understanding of the prevailing attitudes and persistence of the Old South in the NewWritten by a white woman in post-Civil War South Carolina, this portrait offers opinions of male-dominated society, former slaves and the first generation of free-born African-Americans.

Frye took what he called 'a fresh and firsthand look' at the Bible and analysed it as a literary critic, exploring its relation to Western literature and its impact on the creative imagination. Through an examination of such key aspects of language as myth, metaphor, and rhetoric he conveyed to the reader the results of his own encounter with the Bible and his appreciation of its unified structure of narrative and imagery.</p><br><p>Shortly before his death in January 1991, Frye characterized <em>The Double Vision</em> as 'something of a shorter and more accessible version' of The Great Code and its sequel, Words with Power. In simpler context and briefer compass, it elucidates and expands on the ideas and concepts introduced in those books. The 'double vision' of the title is a phrase borrowed from William Blake indicating that mere simple sense perception is not enough for reliable interpretation of the meaning of the world. In Frye's words: 'the conscious subject is not really perceiving until it recognizes itself as part of what it perceives.'</p><br><p>In four very readable, engaging chapters, Frye contrasts the natural or physical vision of the world with the inward, spiritual one as each relates to language, space, time, history, and the concept of God. Throughout, he reiterates that the true literal sense of the Bible is metaphorical and that this conception of a metaphorical literal sense is not new, or even modern. He emphasizes the fact that the literary language of the Bible is not intended, like literature itself, simply to suspend judgement, but to convey a vision of spiritual life that contineus to transform and expand our own. Its myths become, as purely literary myths cannot, myths to live by. Its metaphors become, as purely literary metaphors cannot, metaphors to live in.</p><br><p><em>The Double Vision</em> originated in lectures delivered at Emmanuel College in the University of Toronto, the texts of which were revised and augmented.

In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

Yet, by the nineteenth century, American theology had shifted dramatically away from the severe European traditions directly descended from the Protestant Reformation, of which Puritanism was in the United States the most influential. In its place arose a singularly American set of beliefs. In America's God, Mark Noll has written a biography of this new American ethos. In the 125 years preceding the outbreak of the Civil War, theology played an extraordinarily important role in American public and private life. Its evolution had a profound impact on America's self-definition. The changes taking place in American theology during this period were marked by heightened spiritual inwardness, a new confidence in individual reason, and an attentiveness to the economic and market realities of Western life. Vividly set in the social and political events of the age, <em>America's God</em> is replete with the figures who made up the early American intellectual landscape, from theologians such as Jonathan Edwards, Nathaniel W. Taylor, William Ellery Channing, and Charles Hodge and religiously inspired writers such as Harriet Beecher Stowe and Catherine Stowe to dominant political leaders of the day like Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln. The contributions of these thinkers combined with the religious revival of the 1740s, colonial warfare with France, the consuming struggle for independence, and the rise of evangelical Protestantism to form a common intellectual coinage based on a rising republicanism and commonsense principles. As this Christian republicanism affirmed itself, it imbued in dedicated Christians a conviction that the Bible supported their beliefs over those of all others. Tragically, this sense of religious purpose set the stage for the Civil War, as the conviction of Christians both North and South that God was on their side served to deepen a schism that would soon rend the young nation asunder. Mark Noll has given us the definitive history of Christian theology in America from the time of Jonathan Edwards to the presidency of Abraham Lincoln. It is a story of a flexible and creative theological energy that over time forged a guiding national ideology the legacies of which remain with us to this day.<br></p><p>Mark A. Noll is at Wheaton College, Illinois.<br>"Essential reading for anyone interested in American history, politics and religion."--<em> Themelios</em><p></p><br>"<em>America's God</em> deserves to be hailed as the most comprehensive treatment of early American religious thought. But it is far more than that, since Mr. Noll is tracking here not only the rise and fall of American theology but also the genesis of American civilization...Mr. Noll laments the passing of Christian republicanism and in the end suggests that a dose of Jonathan Edwards ('the last of the Puritans and the first of the evangelicals') may be just what contemporary America needs. You do not have to agree with that assessment to appreciate this fine book, which brings some of the nation's greatest thinkers very much alive."--Wall Street Journal<p></p><br>"Noll belongs to a talented group of historians who have transformed our understanding of American evangelicalism Among Noll's many great strengths (all on display in this immense work) is his comparative method, based on wide learning in Protestant sources worldwide."--<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"Carefully documented and including an excellent bibliography, this insightful volume makes a useful contribution to the study of religion in America"--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"For academics-historians, theologians, and anyone else interested in the history of political thought, religion, philosophy, or theology-this book is essential reading"--<em> The Cresset Epiphany/Lent</em><p></p><br>"Mark Noll's <em>America's God</em> delineates the Americanization of an Old World Protestantism with a breadth, learning, and sophistication unmatched by any other historian. Noll uncovers hidden, obscure figures even as he breathes new life into seemingly familiar names. Those who think intellectual history is dead or irrelevant will be jolted by the wondrous vigor of this exceptional, synoptic book. There's nothing else like it."--Jon Butler, author of <em>Awash in a Sea of Faith: Christianizing the American People</em><p></p><br>"Likely to remain definitive for years to come."--<em>Anglican and Episcopal History</em><p></p><br>"<em>America's God</em> is a richly rewarding work. Awesomely researched and beautifully written, Mark Noll's magisterial study embeds American religious thought from the late Colonial era through the Civil War in its cultural and political context. Not only historians of religion, but everyone interested in the ideas and beliefs that shaped America's past--and still remain potent today--will profit from this insightful interpretive study."--Paul S. Boyer, Editor-in-Chief, <em>The Oxford Companion to United States History</em><p></p><br>"Noll's book is the most comprehensive study of religious ideas in America that we have, and a work that makes the most sustained case for the impact of the spiritual on American public life. The book is original and well argued; and the research is impeccable. Some will not agree with Noll's arguments but everyone interested in religious thought will have to consider them."--Bruce Kuklick, author of <em>A History of Philosophy in America: 1720-2000</em><p></p><br>"This 'social history of theology' in America, from the colonial era through the Civil War, promises to reshape the way we think about American religion, and, indeed, American history...Noll's trademark clarity--both in analysis and in prose--is in evidence here...Equally obvious is Noll's erudite mastery of everything from Puritan ecclesiology to Scottish moral philosophy. This is, finally, the magisterial work that has long been expected from one of our leading historians."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"A broadly based and solid account of the surprising evolution of Christian theology in America during the golden age of Protestant evangelicalism. Mark Noll's magnum opus is a notable achievement of Christian and historical scholarship."--Daniel Walker Howe, Rhodes Professor of American History, Oxford University<p></p><br></p><h2>Pathology for the Health Professions (Pathology for Health Related Professions)</h2><p>Providing a sound foundation of pathology knowledge, <b>Pathology for the Health Professions, 4th Edition</b> gives you a clear, concise, clinically relevant overview of general pathology, including injury, inflammation, and neoplasia, followed by a detailed review of each organ system.

The Platonic-Pythagorean tradition looked on nature in geometric terms with the conviction that the cosmos was constructed according to the principles of mathematical order, while the mechanical philosophy conceived of nature as a huge machine and sought to explain the hidden mechanisms behind phenomena. Pursuing different goals, these two movements of thought tended to conflict with each other, and more than the obviously mathematical sciences were affected - the influence spread as far as chemistry and the life sciences. As this book demonstrates, the full fruition of the scientific revolution required a resolution of the tension between the two dominant trends.</p><p>First published by Wiley in 1971. This is an introduction to the history of science in the seventeenth century.

Although comprehensive in scope, it avoids secondary extensions and developments of materials.Preface <p> Writing a textbook is never easy. For a subject as diverse as investments, the task is particularly difficult. The undisciplined writer could fill volumes and never finish. How does an author best go about organizing the many topics that constitute the field of investments? We chose to start by establishing a basic set of principles to guide our development of Fundamentals of Investments. </p><p> We sincerely believe that the serious student of investments should acquire a balanced knowledge of both investment theory and practice. Granted, someone desiring only an introductory exposure to investment practice could get by with a minimal discussion of theory and focus almost exclusively on institutional details and personal finance applications. That approach, however, would leave the student unable to appreciate the many subtle and important issues faced daily by the investment professional. </p><p> We have structured Fundamentals to present students taking their first course in investments with the basic building blocks of modern investment thought. Although the text is meant to present a thorough discussion of investments, we have constantly tried to remain faithful to three principles:</p><p>Keep the material practical and relevant. Make the text easy to comprehend. Design the text for modular use by instructors. </p><p> First, we have written Fundamentals to give students a working knowledge of the financial instruments available to investors and the ways in which markets for these instruments operate. We have avoided tangential discussions of issues not germane to the primary subject at hand. Second, we want the text to be accessible to students unfamiliar with investments. Therefore, we have tried to write in a clear, concise style, keeping mathematical notation to a minimum, and including numerous examples to explain the concepts presented. Finally, we want instructors to be able to use the text in a modular fashion. Although we have organized the text in what we believe to be a logical order, some instructors may wish to change that order or skip certain sections or chapters entirely. The organization of the text accommodates such preferences. </p><p> This is the third edition of Fundamentals. As any textbook author will attest, a previous work can always be improved. Each time after the first and second editions were published, we received many helpful suggestions from instructors, readers, and reviewers regarding ways in which we could make Fundamentals better. In response, we have made a number of changes that we believe substantially enhance Fundamentals in terms of our goals of practicality, ease of comprehension, and flexibility. Specifically, the third edition contains the following differences from the second:</p><p>Updated material. Where appropriate, we have updated the text to keep students abreast of the latest developments in investments. We have revised tables, graphs, and illustrations to incorporate current information. Furthermore, we have added discussions of recent important academic research. Revised Money Matters. In each chapter we have updated and in some cases replaced the Money Matters features, which are topical discussions designed to show students how some of the concepts described in the text are applied in the "real world." Improved the book's focus. We have concentrated on the most important concepts by eliminating those that have become less important over time. Added statistical concepts review section. In order to understand investments it is important for students to have a solid grounding in basic statistics. We have introduced this review section at the end of Chapter 7 to help refresh the reader's memory. Expanded and improved coverage of efficient markets. This concept plays a central role in modern thinking about investing regardless of ones beliefs. We have approached the subject differently than other texts. Instead of treating the subject in one lengthy section of the book, Chapter 4 provides a concise summary of efficient markets concepts. A review of the literature is then placed in chapters where that discussion is most relevant. Added international content. The globalization of investments is occurring at a rapid pace. It is imperative that students become familiar with an increasingly broad array of international investing concepts. Chapter 26 deals directly with international investing. Moreover, throughout the text we have considerably expanded the discussions of research and data on international securities and securities markets. There are also new discussions of currency management and interest-rate parity. </p><p> Many people ask us how Fundamentals differs from our other book, Investments. After all, Investments, now in its sixth edition, has been one of the most successful finance textbooks published. Why another version of such a popular text? </p><p> Both Fundamentals and Investments are comprehensive, covering all of the major aspects and theories of investing, while avoiding excess detail. Furthermore, both books contain similar features, such as a glossary of terms introduced in the text, and both books offer an instructor's manual and investment software. </p><p> Investments, however, is written primarily for students who have stronger backgrounds in economics, statistics, and accounting. We felt that most students in their first investments course could benefit from a textbook designed to provide a less theoretical and technical approach to investments. Therefore, although we have not ignored the quantitative nature of modern investment theory and practice, we have considerably reduced the mathematical content from that contained in Investments. Moreover, we have organized Fundamentals in a different manner. Specifically, Fundamentals is organized in a modular fashion, as mentioned earlier, whereas Investments has a presentation style that is more integrated. </p><p> Fundamentals contains several teaching aids that we believe instructors will find valuable. The terms highlighted within the text and noted marginally in each chapter emphasize important concepts. The glossary allows students to quickly reference terms discussed earlier in the text, thereby creating a continuity of concepts across chapters. The point-by-point chapter summaries permit students to easily identify essential thoughts developed in each chapter. </p><p> We are particularly proud of the Money Matters articles presented in each chapter. Specifically written for Fundamentals, these articles are designed to give students a sense of how various investment issues are approached by practitioners as well as a glimpse of the techniques that are used. For example, the Money Matters box in Chapter 2 compares the various types of brokers, ranging from full-service to discount to online brokers; Chapter 18 discusses assessing manager skill; and Chapter 26 considers the controversial issue of whether to hedge a foreign investment portfolio. Furthermore, Ann Sherman, a recent faculty member of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for six years, wrote the Money Matters feature in Chapter 13 about raising capital in the world's largest emerging economy&#x2014;The People's Republic of China. In addition, the Chartered Financial Analyst program is described in the Chapter 14 Money Matters. We believe the Money Matters articles provide both interesting reading for students and a stimulating source of classroom discussion material. </p><p> An extended supplements package accompanies the third edition of Fundamentals. Included in this package are</p><p></p><p>Instructor's Manual. Prepared by the authors, the Instructor's Manual contains detailed solutions to all end-of-chapter questions and problems in the text. A set of course outlines designed to accommodate a variety of teaching approaches is also presented. Test Bank. Completely revised and rewritten by Joseph R Greco of California State University, Fullerton, the test bank contains approximately 1,400 multiple-choice and true/false questions. The third edition Test Bank contains more even coverage of topics and provides three levels of difficulty: knowledge, comprehension, and application/analysis. Prentice Hall Test Manager. The Test Bank is designed for use with the Prentce Hall Test Manager, a computerized package that allows instructors to custom design, save, and generate classroom tests.

And it probably is necessary. One regrets, however, certain editorial decisions. For example, there is no bibliography other than what is found in the essays themselves; in precision and number, these citations are not what one would expect of such histories. The decision to represent a "variety of viewpoints" and to permit "considerable variation in approach, tone, and style" caused huge variations in the value of the various essays. Most are standard scholarly fare, but some are simply too personal and subjective.

But by the early nineteenth century, when the United States was neither a world power nor a primary center of scientific discovery, it was already a leader in communications-in postal service and newspaper publishing, then in development of the telegraph and telephone networks, later in the whole repertoire of mass communications.In this wide-ranging social history of American media, from the first printing press to the early days of radio, Paul Starr shows that the creation of modern communications was as much the result of political choices as of technological invention. With his original historical analysis, Starr examines how the decisions that led to a state-run post office and private monopolies on the telegraph and telephone systems affected a developing society. He illuminates contemporary controversies over freedom of information by exploring such crucial formative issues as freedom of the press, intellectual property, privacy, public access to information, and the shaping of specific technologies and institutions. America&#39;s critical choices in these areas, Starr argues, affect the long-run path of development in a society and have had wide social, economic, and even military ramifications. The Creation of the Media not only tells the history of the media in a new way; it puts America and its global influence into a new perspective.</p><p><b>Paul Starr</b> is Professor of Sociology and Public Affairs at Princeton University and its Woodrow Wilson School of Public Affairs. He is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>The Social Transformation of American Medicine</i> and <i>The Creation of the Media</i>. Starr is the co-founder and editor of <i>The American Prospect</i>. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.In this engrossing, panoramic history of the development of American media, Pulitzer winner Starr (<i>The Social Transformation of American Medicine</i>) ranges from our nation's founding, when the Constitution made the postal service the one nationalized industry and the Bill of Rights denied the federal government any role in regulating the press, to the eve of WWII, when commercial radio broadcasting flourished under very different cultural, political and economic conditions. Throughout, Starr shows that our country's original impulse to promote the postal service and press as part of its vision of nation building established a pattern of support for an open, continent-wide market that would assume different forms and policies as new waves of media were introduced. Starr brilliantly argues, however, that the government preference for keeping things decentralized was finally challenged by the advent of the telegraph, as its technology and associated economies of scale centralized the communications industry. Confronting thorny new issues of monopoly and threats to the guaranteed rights of free expression and individual privacy, the country then had no choice but to take on a regulatory role. Starr vividly demonstrates how complicated that role became with media like motion pictures and broadcasting, as the nation experienced immigration, urbanization and major cultural shifts: suddenly, counter forces in favor of moral regulation were petitioning the government to use all of its power to restrain mass media. The culture wars had begun. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

George Bush President Was a Helper Helping that fellow clear his airspace by signing the Santa Claus Clause was a great privilege of my office. A great privilege." Sir Edmund Hillary New Information on Everest The local people insisted there was something happening up there on the summit every December. Tenzing must have believed that. At the top, I saw him place some cookies in the snow." Al Roker Forecaster to the Elves In one hour in New York you can have snow, ice, rain&#x2014;then it changes back to snow! Santa has to know what's going on. I tell him." Will Steger Only Man to Visit the Village It was big, but it was small. It was calm, but it was bustling. It was happy&#x2014;yes, I would even say it was jolly. The village was precisely like Santa Claus himself!"</p><p>Lest you think that Christmas is just a sentimental commercial venture perpetuated by misguided Victorian-era worshippers, <i>Flight of the Reindeer</i> offers proof positive that there is a Santa Claus and yes, reindeer really do know how to fly. Robert Sullivan, a senior editor at <i>Life</i> magazine, diligently gathered documentation from respected scientists, historians, zoologists, and Arctic explorers to prove once and for all that Santa is not just a myth. The gorgeous illustrations, convincing photos, and smoothly written text make this book an ideal gift for children who are teetering on the edge of nonbelief and an even better one for grownups who long ago gave up hope.Flight of the Reindeer Children have believed the legend forever: On one special evening each year a jolly old elf (with a taste for red suits) and eight tiny reindeer (plus one with a red nose) fly all night long to deliver gifts around the world. The fact is, solid evidence abounds&#x2014;from scientists, historians, Arctic explorers and other experts&#x2014;that this is not a legend at all, and that the children have been right all along. In Flight of the Reindeer, Robert Sullivan has gathered a wealth of evidence, including photos, illustrations and eyewitness accounts, both old and new, to present the wondrous story of The Christmas Mission. First, the reindeer: Do they really fly? "We used to think it was just extended leaping," says Tony Vecchio, Director of the Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island. "But recent evidence has confirmed that it is true flight." In fact there is one remarkable breed that flies with a grace and speed unmatched in the animal kingdom. Dasher is one of this breed. So are Dancer, Donder and the other members of "The Team." And Santa Claus? "He's just as real as the gifts he brings," reports Will Steger, the famed Arctic explorer, who, ten years ago, became the first person ever to visit the elusive North Pole village. Steger returned with some astonishing photographic evidence of the village, as well as words of wisdom from the legend himself." I was surprised by how open he was and how much information he wanted me to bring back," says Steger. Indeed, it seems that while Santa feels strongly that he and his village must live and work in isolation, he is not at all reluctant to have us know certain things. In fact, he seems to want us to know. And now, with Flight of the Reindeer, we do.</p><h2>The Tribal Arts of Africa</h2><p>Accompanied by a reference section, a survey of more than two millennia of African art describes the society and culture of forty-nine African tribes and presents seven hundred examples, including 195 in color, of their art, from ritualistic items to common utensils.</p><p>Jean-Baptiste Bacquart is head of the Tribal Art department at Sotheby&#39;s, London.The layout is particularly interesting because it intersperses dramatic color photographs with small black-and-white photographs and text about the art, the tribes and the traditions.

Prominent political analyst Peter Dale Scott begins by tracing America&#x2019;s increasing militarization, restrictions on constitutional rights, and income disparity since the Vietnam War. He argues that a significant role in this historic reversal was the intervention of a series of structural deep events, ranging from the assassination of President Kennedy to 9/11. He does not attempt to resolve the controversies surrounding these events, but he shows their significant points in common, ranging from overlapping personnel and modes of operation to shared sources of funding. Behind all of these commonalities is what Scott calls the deep state: a second order of government, behind the public or constitutional state, that has grown considerably stronger since World War II. He marshals convincing evidence that the deep state is partly institutionalized in non-accountable intelligence agencies like the CIA and NSA, but it also includes private corporations like Booz Allen Hamilton and SAIC, to which 70 percent of intelligence budgets are outsourced. Behind these public and private institutions is the traditional influence of Wall Street bankers and lawyers, allied with international oil companies beyond the reach of domestic law. With the importance of Gulf states like Saudi Arabia to oil markets, American defense companies, and Wall Street itself, this essential book shows that there is now a supranational deep state, sometimes demonstrably opposed to both White House policies and the American public interest.</p><p>Peter Dale Scott, a former Canadian diplomat and professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, is a leading political analyst and poet. His books include Deep Politics and the Death of JFK, Drugs, Oil, and War: The United States in Afghanistan, Colombia, and Indochina, The Road to 9/11: Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America, The War Conspiracy: JFK, 9/11, and the Deep Politics of War, and American War Machine: Deep Politics, the CIA Global Drug Connection, and the Road to Afghanistan (R&amp;L). He has been awarded the Lannan Poetry Award. His website is www.peterdalescott.net.We are living under a government that in certain respects is increasingly lawless and out of control' Scott writes in his latest examination of the alleged underbelly of the U.S. Government. The milieu he shows is rife with shady business deals with the Mafia, as well as terrorists and the countries that harbor them, while encouraging war and eroding personal liberties, all with the stated goal of protecting the country. Scott argues for the existence of what are essentially two governments&#x2014;the one we&#x2019;re familiar with and the 'deep state,' actually running things. In this telling, the latter has been in the works for some time, under the auspices of the need to keep the government running in the event of a major attack or national disaster. Skeptics will be quick to dismiss Scott as a tinfoil-hatted loon looking for conspiracies and collusion under every rock, but the volume of his cited sources begs to differ, suggesting that our current political climate truly is a toxic one in dire need of fixing. He offers a handful of suggestions for doing exactly this in the closing pages of this alarming and thought-provoking work.

(David Talbot, Founder of Salon)<br><br>Peter Dale Scott has pioneered the systematic study of the national security state and its hidden impacts on all areas of foreign and domestic policy. With this new book, Scott outdoes himself with a truly comprehensive birds-eye analysis of the increasing encroachment of the unaccountable 'deep state' into democratic politics through the postwar period until today, offering a window into a grim future if business-as-usual continues. This is a brilliant, incisive, must-read work for anyone who wants to understand the interplay between global capitalism, national security, and the dubious agendas of the most powerful yet secretive agencies of national governments and the complex network of vested criminal and corporate interests that drive them. (Nafeez Ahmed, investigative journalist, the Guardian)<br><br>Peter Dale Scott digs deep into every aspect of Orwellian homeland security&#x2014;from warrantless surveillance to warrantless detention and martial law, showing how the US government and military have become permanently involved in law enforcement. This system of secrecy&#x2014;or secret government&#x2014;is essentially the &#x2018;deep state,&#x2019; the real, powerful layer that overshadows an open government. Yet public institutions account for just one level of the deep state. They also derive their power from key connections outside government&#x2014;as in the case of the CIA, very much rooted in Wall Street. Scott also shows how their power has expanded as the deep state went more and more multinational, in parallel to the expansion of major multinational corporations. Orwellian? No: more like political realism. It's all here. An absolute must read. (Pepe Escobar, roving correspondent for Asia Times and author of Empire of Chaos)</p><h2>Bouncebacks!

The illustrative cases educate emergency physicians in documentation, risk management, and evaluation and management of common ED complaints and diagnoses. <p>Although patients in these cases were not entirely mismanaged, often important "red flags" were missed or ignored. The cases are structured for most learning impact: documentation of initial visits; Greg Henry, MD, FACEP (past president of ACEP) comments on evaluation and documentation from medical and risk management perspectives; final ED visits, diagnosis and hospital/surgical courses; and national experts' referenced discussions of appropriate ED approaches to diagnosis and management. </p><p>Goals include patient safety, continuing education in documentation, risk management, and discussion on evaluation and management of common ED complaints and diagnoses.</p></p><p>Bounce Backs! Emergency department cases: ED returns is an emergency department case study book by Michael B.Weinstock, MD and Ryan Longstreth, MD, with case by case commentary by Greg Henry. <p>The book's primary goal is to improve patient safety. Although these patients were not entirely mismanaged, often important "red flags" were missed or ignored. Additional goals include continuing education in documentation, risk management, and discussion on evaluation and management of common ED complaints and diagnoses. </p><p>Thirty cases of patients are presented who "bounced back" to the ED; some arrested shortly after returning to the ED and some were again discharged (one patient had 6 ED visits). The patients presented with common problems such as headache, fever, abdominal pain, back pain, and chest pain; complaints which could have occurred in any ED, urgent care or primary care physician's office. </p><p>The layout of the book is straightforward. Each chapter begins with documentation of the initial patient visit(s) with the actual physician documentation (with typos, strange abbreviations, etc.), with only minimal modifications to ensure anonymity and readability. Next, Greg Henry comments on the physician's evaluation and documentation from both a medical and risk management perspective. He makes his comments while "blinded" to the eventual ED diagnosis. He does this for all 30 cases. We then present the final ED visit, diagnosis, and hospital/surgical course. </p><p>Finally, there is a referenced discussion of the appropriate ED approach to patients with this presenting complaint and eventual diagnosis by ED leaders including Jeffrey Kline, Steve Colucciello, Andy Jagoda, Amal Mattu, Lance Brown, Ann Dietrich, Sharon Mace, Wyatt Decker, Doug Rund, Raymond Jackson, Robert Dart, Billy Mallon, Stephen Karas, Scott Melanson, Tom Lukens, Sandy Craig, Wesley Eilbert, and Jud Hollander.

A distinguished evolutionary biologist, Roughgarden takes on the medical establishment, the Bible, social science&#x2014;and even Darwin himself. She leads the reader through a fascinating discussion of diversity in gender and sexuality among fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, including primates. <i>Evolution's Rainbow </i>explains how this diversity develops from the action of genes and hormones and how people come to differ from each other in all aspects of body and behavior. Roughgarden reconstructs primary science in light of feminist, gay, and transgender criticism and redefines our understanding of sex, gender, and sexuality. This is a witty, playful, and daring book that has revolutionized our understanding of sexuality.</p><p>"<i>Evolution's Rainbow </i>is an expansively creative challenge to the modern orthodoxies of sexual selection.

But it was her love of teaching that inspired <i>College Rules!</i>. Years of university teaching led her to a firm belief that students can make a smooth transition from high school to college, and should be able to, if they are given the tools.&nbsp;<br><br>Sherrie has published numerous research articles and book chapters that focus on studying and learning, and she has made over 125 presentations at professional meetings.

(We even know some graduate students who would benefit.) However, our major goal is helping college freshmen make the often treacherous transition from learning in high school to learning in college.<br><br> To this end, approach reading <i>College Rules!</i> in any way that suits your needs. You can read it the traditional way&#x2014;start with chapter 1 and read through to the end in consecutive order. If you&#x2019;re a high school student who will be starting college, this ordered approach might be the best.&nbsp;<br><br> You can also use <i>College Rules! </i>as an at-your-fingertips reference for college success. If you feel a bit hesitant as you&#x2019;re packing up your stuff to head off to campus, read chapters 5, 9, and 10. If you&#x2019;re getting ready to take your first college exams (and you haven&#x2019;t even opened this book yet), read chapters 22, 23, and 24. If you can&#x2019;t manage your time worth a hoot, read chapter 7. And everyone can probably benefit from reading chapter 6, &#x201c;Learning 2.0: Technology, College, and You,&#x201d; early on. In other words, we suggest that you read (or reread) the chapters you think will benefit you at any particular time.<br><br> With the second approach, however, we offer a few words of caution. We know for a fact that learning in college is a complex process that involves using all of your senses to learn&#x2014;you use your vision when you read, you speak in discussion, you listen in class, you touch as you create. Being successful is not about doing this or that. Being successful is usually about doing this <i>and</i> that (and then doing some more). There&#x2019;s no one particular suggestion in <i>College Rules!</i> that&#x2019;s guaranteed to make you a better student. There are no &#x201c;magic beans&#x201d; for college success. Rather, we have provided you with a comprehensive guide to help you hit the campus running at least ten paces ahead of your fellow students.&nbsp;<br><br> We wish you the very best of luck as you begin your college journey and hope that, as so many students who had success with the first three editions did, you email us and let us know what you think. Enjoy yourself and have fun&#x2014;but get your work done, too! <i>College Rules!</i> will show you how.</p><h2>Wildness: Relations of People and Place</h2><p><p>Whether referring to a place, a nonhuman animal or plant, or a state of mind, <i>wild</i> indicates autonomy and agency, a will to be, a unique expression of life. Yet two contrasting ideas about wild nature permeate contemporary discussions: either that nature is most wild in the absence of a defiling human presence, or that nature is completely humanized and nothing is truly wild.<br> <br> This book charts a different path. Exploring how people can become attuned to the wild community of life and also contribute to the well-being of the wild places in which we live, work, and play, <i>Wildness</i> brings together esteemed authors from a variety of landscapes, cultures, and backgrounds to share their stories about the interdependence of everyday human lifeways and wildness. As they show, far from being an all or nothing proposition, wildness exists in variations and degrees that range from cultivated soils to multigenerational forests to sunflowers pushing through cracks in a city alley. Spanning diverse geographies, these essays celebrate the continuum of wildness, revealing the many ways in which human communities can nurture, adapt to, and thrive alongside their wild nonhuman kin.<br> <br> From the contoured lands of Wisconsin&#x2019;s Driftless region to remote Alaska, from the amazing adaptations of animals and plants living in the concrete jungle to indigenous lands and harvest ceremonies, from backyards to reclaimed urban industrial sites, from microcosms to bioregions and atmospheres, manifestations of wildness are everywhere. With this book, we gain insight into what wildness is and could be, as well as how it might be recovered in our lives&#x2014;and with it, how we might unearth a more profound, wilder understanding of what it means to be human.<br> <br> <i>Wildness: Relations of People and Place</i> is published in association with the Center for Humans and Nature, an organization that brings together some of the brightest minds to explore and promote human responsibilities to each other and the whole community of life.

Comprehensive, inclusive, and evocative, comfortable enough to be considered literature but groundbreaking enough to enter into discussions of policy and planning for the future, <i>Wildness</i> is storytelling and word-singing at its best. It is also a book I simply (and badly) want on my bookshelf to pull down and read words that flow like water but have the lasting impact of fire.&#x201d; (J.

It discusses in fascinating detail how Lenin's Communist party transformed the Tsarist empire, why Stalin's massive program to industrialize was coupled with one of the most horrific terror campaigns in history, and what we can expect from this erstwhile superpower in the years ahead. Based on extensive research and first-hand knowledge of the Soviet system, it offers a lucid and stimulating analysis of the developments which first sustained, then finally undermined, the Soviet state, pinpointing all the key political developments--revolution, state-building, party rule, terror, Nazi invasion, the Cold War, and the recent elections--and examining their significance in an especially well-wrought historical context. Timely, cogent, and comprehensive, <em>Soviet Politics</em> helps readers make sense of developments in the former USSR since 1985, showing how and why the system fell apart.

Particular attention is given to the interaction of charged particles with the electromagnetic field. The treatment throughout the book is relativistic; the author attempts, as much as possible, a coordinate free (or covariant) form of the equations both for particles and the fields. The book opens with an extensive discussion of space-time, Lorentz transformations, Lorentz-group and tensor and spinor fields. This material is essential to the understanding of many branches of theoretical physics, in particular relativistic quantum theory. Chapter II describes various relativistic forms of the fundamental problem of dynamics: describing the trajectories of particles for given external forces. The general dynamical principles to obtain the field equations and the important problems of the conservation laws are discussed in Chapter III. The second part of the book (Chapters IV-VI) is devoted to a lucid treatment of the <i>interactions</i> of fields and particles. Chapter IV deals with equations of motion and their solutions (the so-called Cauchy problem), focusing on the solution of field equations with Green's functions using Dirac formalism. The problem of feedback between particles and fields (radiation and radiation reaction) is taken up in Chapter V, as are questions concerning the limitations of classical field theories and classical dynamics. Dr. Barut concludes the book with an excellent exposition of the purely mechanical approach to the problem of the interactions of charged particles &#x2014; the so-called action-at-a-distance formulation of electrodynamics. Problems, alternate proofs, and additional topics are included at the end of each chapter, where a useful bibliography is also provided.

The result of this harmony between communities was cultural symbiosis, unbroken until the late twentieth century. The varied art and culture of Moroccan Jewry is seen in this exquisite volume through several lenses: the works of Oriental artists, such as Delacroix, who made the Jews the subjects of their paintings; the intricate jewelry, metalwork, gold thread, and cloth created by the Jews themselves; and Jewish spiritual culture, as manifest in synagogues, in folklore and mysticism, and in pilgrimages to holy sites, many of which were shared with Muslim neighbors. <p>Contributions to Morocco: Jews and Art in a Muslim Land range from discussions of Moroccan Jewish history and spirituality to intensely personal accounts of Jewish&#x2013;Muslim relations in the twentieth century. The mystical experiences of medieval kabbalists sit side by side with childhood memories of the schism in Moroccan society caused by the mass emigration of Jews to Israel after World War II. Collective and personal histories collide, illuminating one another in often unexpected ways, and offering new insights into the nature of this most intriguing outpost of the Diaspora: a rich blend of Spanish, Arabic, and traditional Jewish influences. </p><p>Along with these new and unique perspectives, this fascinating volume contains sumptuous color photography of the artifacts &#x2013; ceramics, textiles, jewelry &#x2013; that Jews in Morocco made, and that to a certain extent defined their daily lives. Morocco: Jews and Art in a Muslim Land sheds new light on the conundrum of Moroccan Jewish identity, from earliest times to the present day.</p>This volume opens with a discussion of the history of Morocco's Jewish communities, followed by fascinating reminiscences from two Moroccan Jews. An informative and important chapter on "The Kabbalah in Morocco" is included, and Mann, the organizer of the show for which this volume serves as catalog, contributes an illuminating chapter titled "Memory, Mimesis, Realia." The book's diverse texts, which intermingle thoughts on the customs of Morocco's Jews and the works created by the country's Jewish artists and artisans, precede a full descriptive catalog that includes beautiful, detailed photographs and informative entries on textiles, jewelry, ceramics, and much more. The essays make this volume a crucial component of the show as well as its faithful record. For all art libraries as well as collections in Jewish and Islamic culture.

The innocent and lovable young man quickly wins the hearts of all his comrades, save one: Claggart, the implacably bitter master-at-arms, who falsely accuses Billy of inciting mutiny. Rich in ambiguities, Herman Melville's haunting parable of the clash between good and evil raises thought-provoking issues related to the conflict between the requirements of the law and the needs of humanity. <br>This is the definitive edition of Melville's classic tale. <i>Billy Budd, Sailor</i> was discovered unfinished in the author's desk shortly after his 1891 death and remained unpublished until 1924. This text&nbsp;is the result of years of study and scrupulous research by Melville scholars. It&nbsp;offers students and other lovers of literature the best and most authentic version of the American storyteller's final masterpiece.</p><p><p>Herman Melville (1819&#x2013;1891) found early success with stories inspired by his adventures in the South Seas. His fortunes declined with the 1851 publication of <i>Moby-Dick, </i>now recognized as a masterpiece but scorned by Melville&#x2019;s contemporaries. The author was obliged to work as a New York City customs inspector and died in obscurity, three decades before the critical reassessment of his work.</p>[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with DEAD AIR and THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE.]--American religious organizations have long embraced radio drama as a vehicle for their messages. Now comes Focus on the Family, syndicating a variety of plays to religious stations on the low end of the FM dial, and now offering them on CD. Produced overseas, these are professional handsome offerings, with didacticism nearly invisible. Father Gilbert, a Scotland Yard detective turned Anglican minister, fights crime like any other shamus, only his perpetrators lurk in the bowels of hell. In DEAD AIR, while appearing on a "chat show," Gilbert receives a chilling phone call that appears connected to a set of murders. It turns out that he is the intended victim, his soul coveted by demons. It's a bit like PBS's "Mystery" series with a soup�on of FAUST. THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE and BILLY BUDD are faithful and endearing versions of C.S. Lewis and Melville, respectively. The former, first published in 1950, derives from Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, a series of sophisticated children's allegorical fantasies set in the mythical kingdom of Narnia. The author was a scholar as well as a writer and religious apologist. The latter presents the often dramatized allegory of good, evil, and self-sacrifice on the high seas of human destiny. Y.R. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award � AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Sense and Sensibility (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>Young women who have no economic or political power must attend to the serious business of contriving material security&#39;. Jane Austen&#39;s sardonic humour lays bare the stratagems, the hypocrisy and the poignancy inherent in the struggle of two very different sisters to achieve respectability. Sense and Sensibility is a delightful comedy of manners in which the sisters Elinor and Marianne represent these two qualities. Elinor&#39;s character is one of Augustan detachment, while Marianne, a fervent disciple of the Romantic Age, learns to curb her passionate nature in the interests of survival.</p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel.

Julie Guthman examines fatness and its relationship to health outcomes to ask if our efforts to prevent &#x201c;obesity&#x201d; are sensible, efficacious, or ethical. She also focuses the lens of obesity on the broader food system to understand why we produce cheap, over-processed food, as well as why we eat it. Guthman takes issue with the currently touted remedy to obesity&#x2015;promoting food that is local, organic, and farm fresh. While such fare may be tastier and grown in more ecologically sustainable ways, this approach can also reinforce class and race inequalities and neglect other possible explanations for the rise in obesity, including environmental toxins. Arguing that ours is a political economy of bulimia&#x2015;one that promotes consumption while also insisting upon thinness&#x2015;Guthman offers a complex analysis of our entire economic system.</p><p>"A bold, compelling challenge to conventional thinking about obesity and its fixes, <i>Weighing In</i> is one of the most important books on food politics to hit the shelves in a long time." &#x2015;Susanne Freidberg, author of <i>Fresh: A Perishable History</i><br><br>"<i>Weighing In</i> is filled with counterintuitive surprises that should make us skeptics of all kinds of food -- whether local, fast, slow, junk or health -- but also gives us the practical tools to effectively scrutinize the stale buffet of popularly-accepted health wisdom before we digest it." &#x2015;Paul Robbins, professor of Geography and Development, University of Arizona<br><br>"If you liked Michael Pollan, this should be your next read. Guthman gives us the research behind the questions we should be asking, but, falling all over ourselves in the rush to consensus, we have overlooked.

By analysing writings of 'the Jeffersonian Circle,' Boorstin explores concepts of God, nature, equality, toleration, education and government in order to illuminate their underlying world view. <i>The Lost World of Thomas Jefferson</i> demonstrates why on the 250th anniversary of his birth, this American leader's message has remained relevant to our national crises and grand concerns.<br> <br> "The volume is too subtle, too rich in ideas for anyone to do justice to it in brief summary, too heavily documented and too carefully wrought for anyone to dismiss its thesis. . . . It is a major contribution not only to Jefferson studies but to American intellectual history. . . . All who work in the history of ideas will find themselves in Mr. Boorstin's debt."&#x2014;Richard Hofstadter, <i>South Atlantic Monthly</i><br></p></p><p>Thomas Jefferson's fame and continued popularity does not depend upon the marvelous personal example he set, as does George Washington's, or upon the remarkable leadership qualities he displayed during the darkest national hours, like Abraham Lincoln's. Instead, he is revered for presenting a unique world-view. Daniel J. Boorstin provides a rich intellectual history of Jefferson's personal and political philosophy: "My purpose has been to get inside the Jeffersonian world of ideas--to see the relation among their conceptions of God, nature, equality, toleration, education, and government.... In a word, I have been more concerned to recapture the Jeffersonian world of ideas than to perform an autopsy on it." Although this particular book is a bit more academic than others by the same author, Boorstin capably explains why Jefferson's voice still resonates long after his passing. <i>--John J. Miller</i>In this classic work by one of America&#39;s most widely read historians, Daniel J. Boorstin demonstrates why and how, on the 250th anniversary of his birth, Thomas Jefferson continues to speak to us.</p><h2>Energy Lab for Kids: 40 Exciting Experiments to Explore, Create, Harness, and Unleash Energy (Volume 11) (Lab for Kids, 11)</h2><p><p><b><i>Energy Lab for Kids </i>offers 40&nbsp;discovery-filled and thought-provoking energy projects by Emily Hawbaker, a science educator from the NEED (National Energy Education Development) project.

Mr. Kessler lives in Potomac, Maryland.</p>The delver into the federal city's loci of power (e.g., <i>Inside the FBI</i> ) will parcel out trivia and occasional substance about recent occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The first half of the text covers philandering, stealing, and drinking during the reigns from LBJ to Bush; the second half details the flaps that have discombobulated the present tenants. Kessler has filled a grab bag of gab from aides, maids, barbers, guards, Secret Service agents, and Air Force One stewards, but some of their revelations bear a serious hearing, such as the $1 <i>billion</i> annual cost of operating the White House. However, Kessler's sharpest criticism is not financial; he hits Clinton in familiar areas of vulnerability, i.e., his staff's juvenile arrogance and ineptitude, "travelgate," "troopergate," and an encore of the Gennifer Flowers allegations of assignations. (This book contains her third set of public statements, following a press conference and <i>Penthouse</i> spread, about her alleged trysts with Clinton.) Because this report seems accurate and few of Kessler's sources hide behind anonymity, it should garner high but ephemeral interest, boosted by a scheduled ABC <i>20/20</i> program in January that will "break" his stories. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>The Tide: The Science and Stories Behind the Greatest Force on Earth</h2><p><p><strong>A rich and sweeping exploration into the science and history behind the most mysterious, primal, and powerful force on earth: the tide.</strong></p><p>Half of the world&#x2019;s population today lives in coastal regions lapped by tidal waters. But the tide rises and falls according to rules that are a mystery to almost all of us. In <em>The Tide</em>, celebrated science writer Hugh Aldersey-Williams weaves together centuries of scientific thinking with the literature and folklore the tide has inspired to explain the power and workings of this most remarkable force.</p><p>Here is the epic story of the long search to understand the tide: from Aristotle, who is said to have drowned himself in his efforts to figure out the Greek tides, to the pioneering investigations into the role of the moon by Galileo and Newton, to the quest to understand and even control the tide in our own time. Throughout, Aldersey-Williams whisks the reader along on his travels in search of the most remarkable tidal phenomena. He visits the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, where the tides are the strongest in the world; arctic Norway, home of the raging tidal whirlpool known as the <em>maelstrom</em>; and Venice, to investigate efforts to defend the city against flooding caused by the famed <em>acqua alta</em>.</p><p>Along the way, Aldersey-Williams delves into classic literary portrayals of the tide from Shakespeare to Dickens, Melville to Jules Verne.

Just as positive psychology focuses on exploring optimal individual psychological states rather than pathological ones, Positive Organizational Scholarship focuses attention on optimal organizational states --- the dynamics in organizations that lead to the development of human strength, foster resiliency in employees, make healing, restoration, and reconciliation possible, and cultivate extraordinary individual and organizational performance.<br> While the concept of positive organizational scholarship encompasses the examination of typical and even dysfunctional patterns of behavior, it emphasizes positive deviance from expected patterns. Positive Organizational Scholarship examines the enablers, motivations, and effects associated with remarkably positive phenomena --- how they are facilitated, why they work, how they can be identified, and how researchers and managers can capitalize on them. The contributors do not adopt one particular theory or framework but draw from the full spectrum of organizational theories to understand, explain, and predict the occurrence, causes, and consequences of positivity.<br> Positive Organizational Scholarship rigorously seeks to understand what represents the best of the human condition based on scholarly research and theory. This book invites organizational scholars to build upon and extend the positive organizational phenomena being examined. It provides the definitional, theoretical, and empirical foundations for what will become a cumulative body of enduring work.</p><p>Kim S. Cameron is professor of organizational behavior in the School of Business and professor of higher education in the School of Education at the University of Michigan.

This new edition includes: revision of the text in light of the most recent scholarly discussions, completely updated bibliographies, new charts, diagrams, and study aids, two new appendices (New Approaches to the Text and the Historical Jesus).</p><p>Luke Timothy Johnson is the Robert W. Woodruff Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.I have written this book for those who want to understand the origin and shape of the New Testament writings but are unable to find a comprehensive introduction that is neither repellingly technical nor appallingly trivial. I have called it an interpretation rather than an introduction for the simple reason that most volumes going by the name of introduction are either handbooks devoted to the communication of information concerning a narrow range of scholarly issues or popularized versions of conventional scholarly wisdom for college students. In contrast to both, I have tried to provide a genuine interpretation of Christianity's earliest writings. By so doing I draw the reader into the most important critical questions concerning their understanding. In this sense, every interpretation is also an introduction. By no means is every introduction an interpretation. <p>The organization of this book, its argument, and the choice of topics have all been dictated by the desire to make these writings intelligible and alive for the contemporary reader who want to meet and understand them more than scholarly discussions of them. I have considered all the critical issues pertinent to the understanding of the writings, but I have gone beyond presenting a consensus of scholarly opinion. The reader will find in these pages a signal "reading" of the evidence from beginning to end---my own. My approach to the writings and the critical issues is independent. It is not, I think, idiosyncratic. I have learned more than I can ever credit to my teachers and to the reading of other scholars. But in this book I advance my own understanding of the New Testament in its origin, in each of its parts, and as a collection. Sometimes I agree with the majority of scholars; sometimes I disagree. I have tried to indicate the reasons for both. As in every attempt to deal with the whole of a subject within a reasonable space, much has been eliminated or abbreviated. More advanced readers should recognize in my sometimes elliptical remarks a thoughtful response to critical scholarship. </p><p>In order to keep my argument and presentation clean I have not used footnotes, nor do I refer to other scholars by name in the text. The reader will, I hope, forgive the inevitable air of omniscience that results. It seemed better to restrict reference to primary sources, above all the texts of the New Testament itself. Occasionally even these are so numerous as to make the detection of decent prose a problem. At the end of each chapter I have provided an annotated bibliography. Some entries support my presentation, others provide alternative points of view, still other give the reader additional resources for study. With very few exceptions I have included only literature in English, since the notes are meant to be an aid to the reader rather than a demonstration of learning. Given the rate of translation, not that much of great value is missing. I have also tried to refer to literature that is reasonably available. Translations of primary sources are acknowledged at the head of each bibliographical section. ---Preface to First Edition </p><p>The first edition of The Writings of the New Testament: An Interpretation appeared in 1986. The manuscript for that edition was completed in 1984. The bibliographies were fairly up-to-date but included only a few items from 1984. The contents of the books are therefore almost fifteen years old. Despite the usefulness of the first edition---it went through thirteen printings---it is clearly time for a new edition. </p><p>I have not changed the basic philosophy or design of the book. I have simply tried to update and improve it. The updating takes two basic forms. The first is the completely revised bibliographies. Some older items are eliminated; many more recent items are included. I have continued to use only English-language references for the reasons stated in the first edition. The second updating is found in two appendices. One deals with newer methods that have developed over the past fifteen years; it is only a sketch but it shows the general lines of development and its bibliography provides some starting points for reading. The other appendix deals with the question of the Historical Jesus. I explain why I continue to omit this topic from the body of the book, and try to indicate some of the critical questions and sources to consult. </p><p>The improvement of the book is found in the line-by-line editing. Every sentence has been assessed for accuracy and clarity. Many passages have been rewritten, some have been omitted, some added. The argument of each chapter remains the same, though I hope it is clearer and more accessible. All of the references have been checked and corrected. I have also added study questions at the end of each chapter to make the book an even better teaching tool. ---Preface to Revised Edition</p></p><h2>Chemistry: An Introduction To General, Organic, And Biological Chemistry</h2><p><p><b></b> <i>Chemistry: An Introduction To General, Organic, And Biological Chemistry, Ninth Edition</i> makes chemistry exciting to readers by showing them why important concepts are relevant to their lives and future careers.

Yet what is their function within today's society? At the present time, when funding is becoming increasingly scarce, difficult questions are being asked about the justification of museums. <em>Museums and the Shaping of Knowledge</em> presents a critical survey of major changes in current assumptions about the nature of museums. Through the examination of case studies, Eilean Hooper-Greenhill reveals a variety of different roles for museums in the production and shaping of knowledge. Today, museums are once again organising their spaces and collections to present themselves as environments for experimental and self-directed learning. </p></p><p></p><h2>The Sacred Paths of the West</h2><p>This text combines study of the dynamic historical development of each religious tradition with a comparative thematic structure. Students are encouraged to discover and explore the nature of religious experience by comparing basic themes and issues common to all religions, finding connections with their own personal experiences. By sensitively introducing descriptive material within a comparative thematic structure, this text helps students to understand how each religion provides, for its adherents, patterns and meanings that make up a full way of life.</p><p>Introduces students to the western religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam by integrating historical descriptions with thematic comparisons of each. A revised and excerpted version of The Sacred Paths: Understanding the Religions of the World, the text approaches these religions as historically unique systems and focuses on comparative key themes and issues to enrich understanding of each religion&#39;s experience. The book also includes an extensive introduction to religion, as well as a chapter that explores the religions of the ancient world. The author&#39;s accessible approach and clear writing style enables students to experience the essence of each religion and to apply the tenets of these religions to their own religious experiences.Preface to the Second Edition <p> This study of the religions of the West incorporates material from a larger volume on the whole range of the world's religious traditions, The Sacred Paths: Understanding the Religions of the World, third edition (Prentice Hall, 2001). The new edition has been revised to bring material up-to-date and to provide the reader with greater clarity in the discussions of complex historical and theoretical material. </p> <p> Designed for those who want to concentrate on the religious traditions that have shaped Western culture, this volume focuses on the three Abrahamic religions�Judaism, Christianity, and Islamin�in the context of the ancient traditions of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece. To round out this context, a new chapter, on the important Zoroastrian tradition, has been added. </p> <p> To serve the needs of people who are beginning their study of the world's religions, the basic approach in this volume is focused on the goal of understanding. And understanding begins with a sense of what a particular religion means for the people who practice it and live by it. It is important to realize that each religious tradition is a living and growing organism stretched out over time, and thus we pay attention to historical and cultural developments. But we also attempt to go beyond historical information and let readers find themselves in the place of the people who live by each religion-viewing the world through their sacred stories, their worldview, their rituals, and their notion of the good life. </p> <p> The procedure used in this volume, then, combines the necessary discussion of historical matters with a thematic approach based on general issues that arise out of human experience�questions about personal identity, human existence and wholeness, and the right way to live. Since the reader can identify with such issues from personal experience, windows are opened toward an understanding of the meaning and guidance people find in their particular religious traditions. Further, this combination of historical and thematic approaches facilitates comparison among the religious traditions, highlighting the main motifs and concerns of that general dimension of human life we call religious experience. </p> <p> Since this is a basic introduction for people who are beginning their exploration of the world's religious paths, the major focus is not on academic questions and theories about religion, nor on technical information about all the movements and historical developments that make up each religious tradition. Such theories and developments are important, of course, and this volume attempts to make readers aware of them in a beginning way. It is important that readers get the sense that each religious tradition is a highly complex living organism, with various movements arising at different points in history. Yet it is helpful for the beginning student to recognize first of all the general mainstream of each religious tradition in constructing an overall picture of the religious world of the West. The excitement and challenge of this venture will carry over, it is hoped, into a continuing engagement with understanding the complex religious traditions of the world and with the various issues raised in the academic study of these traditions. </p> <p> It is particularly important that readers have some encounter with the sacred texts and scriptures of each particular religious tradition�yet the comprehension and appreciation of such sacred texts is notoriously difficult for an outsider. This volume incorporates extensive quotations from the sacred texts of each tradition, providing interpretation so the reader can see the significance of these texts and comprehend what they mean for people of that religious tradition. It will be helpful, of course, if this volume is supplemented with an additional collection of sacred texts, when that is feasible. </p> <p> The inclusion of material on artistic expression in the different religious traditions helps the reader see that each religion or culture has its own unique aesthetic sense. Thus it is important, for understanding each tradition, to pay attention to the special artistic expressions growing out of that religious experience. Also, this volume gives particular attention to the role of women in each tradition. Greater awareness of women's experiences and leadership roles has made possible many new understandings and insights in all the religious traditions. Further, an important development in the modern Western world is the rise of new religious movements, and a special chapter is devoted to understanding some of these alternative movements. </p> <p> Among the study features in this volume, the discussion questions for each chapter have been revised and expanded. These questions are designed to promote review of the material as well as further reflection on the character of each religious tradition. Other study features include maps, timelines, and a glossary of key terms. The suggestions for further reading for each religious tradition have incorporated many important books that have been published in the last few years. </p> <p> Many have helped along the way in the development of this book and toward the completion of this second edition. And so I thank all those students and colleagues who have made so many helpful suggestions concerning ways in which this text can become a more helpful means for understanding the religious paths of the world.</p></p><h2>Exploring Creation with Advanced Physics</h2><p>This textbook is one part of a two-book set.

So he decided to use his award-winning journalistic skills to investigate Jesus and prove once and for all if all the claims about him are true. <em>The Case for Christ Student Edition</em> adapts Strobel&#x2019;s <em>New York Times </em>bestselling book to present hard-hitting findings as well as Lee&#x2019;s journey from skepticism to belief in an easy-to-follow manner so you can make a decision about Jesus for yourself.</strong></p><p>There's historical proof a guy named Jesus walked on the earth ... but was he really performing miracles? Did he actually rise from the dead? And was he truly the prophesied savior he claimed to be? Lee Strobel found it all hard to believe, and his doubts led him to ask the tough questions and dig into the real evidence to see if the Bible's claims and Jesus's words were true. Inside this book is the scientific data, expert testimonies and interviews, cross-religious comparisons, historical and archeological proofs he discovered during his investigation, and the conclusion he finally came to about Christianity that changed his life forever.

But miracles? Rising from the dead? Some of the stories you hear about him sound like just that--stories. A reasonable person would never believe them, let alone the claim that he&#39;s the only way to God!But a reasonable person would also make sure that he or she understood the facts before jumping to conclusions. That&#39;s why Lee Strobel--an award-winning legal journalist with a knack for asking tough questions--decided to investigate Jesus for himself. An atheist, Strobel felt certain his findings would bring Christianity&#39;s claims about Jesus tumbling down like a house of cards. He was in for the surprise of his life. Join him as he retraces his journey from skepticism to faith. You&#39;ll consult expert testimony as you sift through the truths that history, science, psychiatry, literature, and religion reveal.

Nine black teenagers in Little Rock, Arkansas, headed out to a formerly white high school, despite warnings that "blood will run in the streets." James Lawson trained activists not to fight back with fists or words, no matter how many billy clubs rained down on them. Through ten turbulent years, black southerners filled jails and public places with the songs and strength passed down from their ancestors. This final book in a trilogy about the African-American experience is a tribute to the crusaders for equality and peace in America, a crusade that continues to this day. Back matter includes important dates, an artist&#x2019;s note, source notes, a bibliography, sources for further information, and an index.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>Grade 4-8&#x2013;This is the concluding book in a trilogy that chronicles the black experience in America. Rappaport draws on songs, poems, memories, letters, court testimony, and first-person accounts to provide a moving portrayal of the experiences of African Americans from the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott to the Voting Rights Act in July 1965. The book introduces little-known as well as famous figures and incidents in a way that is fresh and informative. One example is the story of Mose Wright, who testified in the Emmett Till murder case&#x2013;a black man who had never spoken up against a white man, but is determined to tell the truth today. Evans's earth-toned oil paintings enhance the stories with images that are by turns poignant, sad, hurtful, resigned, determined, hopeful, and triumphant. In a concluding artist's note, Evans eloquently states: ...as you read the words and gaze at the images in this 'ourstory,' put yourselves in the shoes of these people who fought and loved so hard, for they are all of us. A wonderful resource to enhance curriculum units on African-American history.<i>&#x2013;Mary N.

Part Two contains studies of weathering, climate, and such denudational processes as flooding and erosion. Here, too, are examinations of the drainage basin as a geomorphic unit, water and sediment in channels, channel form and process, and hillslope characteristics and processes.<br>In Part III, the authors cover geochronology, drainage pattern evolution, channel changes with time, and the evolution of hillslopes. Two appendixes will help readers convert units and equivalents, and identify symbols and nomenclature. 1964 edition.</p><p></p><h2>Real World Psychology 2nd Edition WileyPLUS Card</h2><p>This textbook was made specifically for Richland College (has a cover for that school).</p><p></p><h2>The Theory of Communicative Action: Lifeworld and Systems, a Critique of Functionalist Reason, Volume 2</h2><p>This study offers a systematic reconstruction of the theoretical foundations and framework of critical social theory It is Habermas magnum opus and it is regarded as one of the most important works of modern social thought In this second and final volume of the work Habermas examines the relations between action concepts and systems theory and elaborates a framework for analyzing the developmental tendencies of modern societies He discusses in detail the work of Marx Durkheim G H Mead and Talcott Parsons among others By distinguishing between social systems and what he calls the life world Habermas is able to analyze the ways in which the development of social systems impinges upon the symbolic and subjective dimensions of social life resulting in the kind of crises conflicts and protest movements which are characteristic of advanced capitalist societies in the late 20th century</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Secret Adversary (Tommy and Tuppence)</h2><p><b>The novel that introduced Tommy and Tuppence, a bantering pair of 1920s bright young things who solve a mystery together while falling for each other.</b><br><br>The Great War is over and jobs are scarce. Tommy Beresford and Prudence "Tuppence" Cowley, who were friends before the war, run into each other in London and discover they are both equally short of money and opportunities. On a whim, they decide to start a business, advertising themselves as "The Young Adventurers." Their first job leads them into a series of increasingly dangerous situations involving international spies, a society beauty, a Russian count, the wreck of the <i>Lusitania</i>, an amnesia patient, an American millionaire, and a fiendishly clever arch-criminal known only as "Mr. Brown." By the time the dust settles, all the puzzle pieces have been fitted together--and the young couple have realized their feelings for each other and have become engaged.</p><p>AGATHA CHRISTIE (1890-1976) was born in Devon, England. She wrote more than seventy books and 150 short stories, as well as works for stage and screen. Her novel <i>And Then There Were None</i> is considered the world's bestselling mystery novel, and her play <i>The Mousetrap</i> is the longest-running play in London theater history.<b>Chapter One</b><br><b>The Young Adventurers, Ltd.</b><br><br>&#x201c;Tommy, old thing!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tuppence, old bean!&#x201d;<br><br>The two young people greeted each other affectionately, and momentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The adjective &#x201c;old&#x201d; was misleading. Their united ages would certainly not have totalled forty-five.<br><br>&#x201c;Not seen you for simply centuries,&#x201d; continued the young man. &#x201c;Where are you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We&#x2019;re getting a bit unpopular here&#x2014;blocking the gangway as it were. Let&#x2019;s get out of it.&#x201d;<br><br>The girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street towards Piccadilly.<br><br>&#x201c;Now then,&#x201d; said Tommy, &#x201c;where shall we go?&#x201d;<br><br>The very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute ears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate friends for some mysterious reason as &#x201c;Tuppence.&#x201d; She pounced at once.<br><br>&#x201c;Tommy, you&#x2019;re stony!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a bit of it,&#x201d; declared Tommy unconvincingly. &#x201c;Rolling in cash.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You always were a shocking liar,&#x201d; said Tuppence severely, &#x201c;though you did once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer as a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the chart. Do you remember?&#x201d;<br><br>Tommy chuckled.<br><br>&#x201c;I should think I did! Wasn&#x2019;t the old cat in a rage when she found out? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank! Good old hospital&#x2014;demobbed like everything else, I suppose?&#x201d;<br><br>Tuppence sighed.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. You too?&#x201d;<br><br>Tommy nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Two months ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gratuity?&#x201d; hinted Tuppence.<br><br>&#x201c;Spent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Tommy!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The cost of living&#x2014;ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I assure you, if you do not know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My dear child,&#x201d; interrupted Tuppence, &#x201c;there is nothing I do not know about the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons&#x2019;, and we will each of us pay for our own. That&#x2019;s that!&#x201d; And Tuppence led the way upstairs.<br><br>The place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table, catching odds and ends of conversation as they did so.<br><br>&#x201c;And&#x2014;do you know, she sat down and cried when I told her she couldn&#x2019;t have the flat after all.&#x201d; &#x201c;It was simply a bargain, my dear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Funny scraps one does overhear,&#x201d; murmured Tommy. &#x201c;I passed two Johnnies in the street today talking about someone called Jane Finn. Did you ever hear such a name?&#x201d;<br><br>But at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels, and Tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats.<br><br>Tommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast.<br><br>&#x201c;And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,&#x201d; she added severely.<br><br>Tommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock of exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly ugly&#x2014;nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of its tether.<br><br>They were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there. Tuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in the elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large, wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black brows. She wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair, and her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of uncommonly dainty ankles. Her appearance presented a valiant attempt at smartness.<br><br>The tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of meditation, poured it out.<br><br>&#x201c;Now then,&#x201d; said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s get up to date. Remember, I haven&#x2019;t seen you since that time in hospital in 1916.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very well.&#x201d; Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast. &#x201c;Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the delights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up to London, where she entered an officers&#x2019; hospital. First month: Washed up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted to drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes. Fourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month: Promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth month: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters! Eighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven&#x2019;s egg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important matters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the mighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I found a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow, Tommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was affecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in company with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties resumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively a trade delivery van, a motor lorry and a general. The last was the pleasantest. He was quite a young general!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What blighter was that?&#x201d; inquired Tommy. &#x201c;Perfectly sickening the way those brass hats drove from the War Office to the Savoy, and from the Savoy to the War Office!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve forgotten his name now,&#x201d; confessed Tuppence. &#x201c;To resume, that was in a way the apex of my career. I next entered a Government office. We had several very enjoyable tea parties. I had intended to become a land girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off my career&#x2014;but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the office with the true limpet touch for many long months, but, alas, I was combed out at last. Since then I&#x2019;ve been looking for a job. Now then&#x2014;your turn.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s not so much promotion in mine,&#x201d; said Tommy regretfully, &#x201c;and a great deal less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. Then they sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the second time, and went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened, kicked my heels there some time longer, and, as I told you, finally got demobbed. And, for ten long, weary months I&#x2019;ve been job hunting! There aren&#x2019;t any jobs! And, if there were, they wouldn&#x2019;t give &#x2019;em to me. What good am I? What do I know about business? Nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>Tuppence nodded gloomily.<br><br>&#x201c;What about the colonies?&#x201d; she suggested.<br><br>Tommy shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t like the colonies&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m perfectly certain they wouldn&#x2019;t like me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rich relations?&#x201d;<br><br>Again Tommy shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got an old uncle who&#x2019;s more or less rolling, but he&#x2019;s no good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I remember hearing about it,&#x201d; said Tuppence slowly. &#x201c;You refused because of your mother&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Tommy flushed.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know, I was all she had. Old boy hated her&#x2014;wanted to get me away from her. Just a bit of spite.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your mother&#x2019;s dead, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; said Tuppence gently.<br><br>Tommy nodded.<br><br>Tuppence&#x2019;s large grey eyes looked misty.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rot!&#x201d; said Tommy hastily. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s my position. I&#x2019;m just about desperate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So am I! I&#x2019;ve hung out as long as I could. I&#x2019;ve touted round. I&#x2019;ve answered advertisements. I&#x2019;ve tried every mortal blessed thing. I&#x2019;ve screwed and saved and pinched! But it&#x2019;s no good. I shall have to go home!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I don&#x2019;t want to! What&#x2019;s the good of being sentimental? Father&#x2019;s a dear&#x2014;I&#x2019;m awfully fond of him&#x2014;but you&#x2019;ve no idea how I worry him! He has that delightful early Victorian view that short skirts and smoking are immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I am to him! He just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off. You see, there are seven of us at home. It&#x2019;s awful! All housework and mothers&#x2019; meetings! I have always been the changeling. I don&#x2019;t want to go back, but&#x2014;oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?&#x201d;<br><br>Tommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst out:<br><br>&#x201c;Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I daresay it&#x2019;s mercenary of me, but there it is!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Same here,&#x201d; agreed Tommy with feeling.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,&#x201d; continued Tuppence. &#x201c;There are only three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make it. First is ruled out. I haven&#x2019;t got any rich elderly relatives. Any relatives I have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen! I always help old ladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case they should turn out to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them has ever asked me my name&#x2014;and quite a lot never said &#x2018;Thank you.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>There was a pause.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; resumed Tuppence, &#x201c;marriage is my best chance. I made up my mind to marry money when I was quite young. Any thinking girl would! I&#x2019;m not sentimental, you know.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Come now, you can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m sentimental,&#x201d; she added sharply.<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly not,&#x201d; agreed Tommy hastily. &#x201c;No one would ever think of sentiment in connexion with you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not very polite,&#x201d; replied Tuppence. &#x201c;But I daresay you mean it all right. Well, there it is! I&#x2019;m ready and willing&#x2014;but I never meet any rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about the general?&#x201d; inquired Tommy.<br><br>&#x201c;I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,&#x201d; explained Tuppence. &#x201c;No, there it is! Now you could marry a rich girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m like you. I don&#x2019;t know any.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a man in a fur coat come out of the Ritz I can&#x2019;t rush up to him and say: &#x2018;Look here, you&#x2019;re rich. I&#x2019;d like to know you.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or something like that. If she thinks you want to know her she&#x2019;s flattered, and will manage it for you somehow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You overrate my manly charms,&#x201d; murmured Tommy.<br><br>&#x201c;On the other hand,&#x201d; proceeded Tuppence, &#x201c;my millionaire would probably run for his life! No&#x2014;marriage is fraught with difficulties. Remains&#x2014;to make money!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve tried that, and failed,&#x201d; Tommy reminded her.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the unorthodox. Tommy, let&#x2019;s be adventurers!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; replied Tommy cheerfully. &#x201c;How do we begin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might hire us to commit crimes for them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Delightful,&#x201d; commented Tommy. &#x201c;Especially coming from a clergyman&#x2019;s daughter!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The moral guilt,&#x201d; Tuppence pointed out, &#x201c;would be theirs&#x2014;not mine. You must admit that there&#x2019;s a difference between stealing a diamond necklace for yourself and being hired to steal it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There wouldn&#x2019;t be the least difference if you were caught!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps not. But I shouldn&#x2019;t be caught. I&#x2019;m so clever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Modesty always was your besetting sin,&#x201d; remarked Tommy.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a business partnership?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was only an illustration. Let&#x2019;s have a&#x2014;what do you call it in bookkeeping?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. Never did any.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have&#x2014;but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit entries on the debit side, and vice versa&#x2014;so they fired me out. Oh, I know&#x2014;a joint venture! It struck me as such a romantic phrase to come across in the middle of musty old figures. It&#x2019;s got an Elizabethan flavour about it&#x2014;makes one think of galleons and doubloons. A joint venture!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that your idea, Tuppence?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be employers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Advertisement,&#x201d; replied Tuppence promptly. &#x201c;Have you got a bit of paper and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we have hairpins and powder puffs.&#x201d;<br><br>Tommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence began writing busily.<br><br>&#x201c;Shall we begin: &#x2018;Young officer, twice wounded in the war&#x2014;&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort of thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she might adopt you, and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be adopted.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging you! The papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now listen&#x2014;how&#x2019;s this? &#x2018;Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.&#x2019; (We might as well make that clear from the start.) Then we might add: &#x2018;No reasonable offer refused&#x2019;&#x2014;like flats and furniture.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty unreasonable one!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tommy! You&#x2019;re a genius! That&#x2019;s ever so much more chic. &#x2018;No unreasonable offer refused&#x2014;if pay is good.&#x2019; How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t mention pay again. It looks rather eager.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It couldn&#x2019;t look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right. Now I&#x2019;ll read it straight through. &#x2018;Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer refused.&#x2019; How would that strike you if you read it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a lunatic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning &#x2018;Petunia&#x2019; and signed &#x2018;Best Boy.&#x2019; &#x201d; She tore out the leaf and handed it to Tommy. &#x201c;There you are. The Times, I think. Reply to Box so-and-so. I expect it will be about five shillings. Here&#x2019;s half a crown for my share.&#x201d;<br><br>Tommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His face burned a deeper red.<br><br>&#x201c;Shall we really try it?&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;Shall we, Tuppence? Just for the fun of the thing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tommy, you&#x2019;re a sport! I knew you would be! Let&#x2019;s drink to success.&#x201d; She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.<br><br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s to our joint venture, and may it prosper!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Young Adventurers, Ltd.!&#x201d; responded Tommy.<br><br>They put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence rose.<br><br>&#x201c;I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz,&#x201d; agreed Tommy with a grin. &#x201c;Where shall we meet? And when?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twelve o&#x2019;clock tomorrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that suit you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My time is my own,&#x201d; replied Mr. Beresford magnificently.<br><br>&#x201c;So long, then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good-bye, old thing.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Way of Life, Like Any Other (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>The hero of Darcy O'Brien's <i>A Way of Life, Like Any Other</i> is a child of Hollywood, and once his life was a glittery dream.

Ewald,</b> professor of biology at Amherst College, was the first recipient of the George R. Burch Fellowship in Theoretic Medicine and Affiliated Sciences. The publication of his <i>Evolution of Infectious Disease</i> is widely acknowledged by doctors and scientists as a watershed in the emergence of the new discipline of evolutionary medicine. He has been featured in <i>The Atlantic, Newsweek, Discover,</i> and <i>Forbes.</i> He lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.Plague Time is about the likelihood that infections cause atherosclerosis, some cancers, and other chronic diseases. This is certainly a current theory, and the book could be useful to readers who have not followed the literature in support of this thesis. Among the conclusions presented are that most of our diseases are caused by unrecognized infections and that more money should be spent on research on infectious diseases. <p> I laud these conclusions, yet I cannot applaud the book. Ewald is guilty of overkill. A constantly recurring theme in the book is that the medical establishment has been too slow to recognize new ideas and to effect change. An example is that successful antibiotic treatment of peptic ulcers was first tried in 1955, and the fact that it took 40 years for the medical establishment to accept the notion that peptic ulcers are a treatable infectious disease has caused many to suffer and die. Another is that of cervical cancer and the "high-risk" subtypes of human papillomavirus. Ewald argues that thousands have probably died from cervical cancer because it was treated as bad luck rather than as a preventable sexually transmitted disease. </p><p> Ewald believes that there is a bias against attributing diseases to infectious causes. The credo he recommends to modern-day microbe hunters is to investigate the chronic diseases that most experts do not think are caused by infection and figure out how to control them. Ewald believes that the emphasis of modern genetics is misplaced and that the Human Genome Project is a case in point. The important genes, he believes, will turn out to be those of infectious agents and those that control the human response to infection. </p><p> Ewald argues that we set the standard for the acceptance of such theories too high and that we should lower our thresholds. He wants anecdotal information, screened by some good method, to be used more effectively. But we already live in a world in which everything gets published somewhere. If you believe something, you can certainly find some report, somewhere, to support it. </p><p> A number of conditions are discussed extensively, including atherosclerosis, which, notes Ewald, may be caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, a very common infection. This issue is currently the subject of intense international research activity, but researchers have yet to prove a causal relation. </p><p> The bottom line is that the contentions here are carried too far. Ewald seems to believe that any deviation from the norm could be caused by an infection -- even, he suggests, artistic creativity. I find this way of thinking frightening. </p><p> Ewald also stresses that the supposition that the infectious agent and its host will, over time, put selective pressures on each other toward the persistence of both and the least damage to either is not necessarily true. The evidence against this principle comes from situations in which the rapid transmission of an organism occurs, with selection for increased virulence -- for instance, in locations where there is a high degree of crowding, mobility, and sexual contact as well as poor sanitary conditions. Ewald discusses such short-term success of highly virulent organisms as a revelation of "evolutionary biology." However, Sir Macfarlane Burnet, one of the leading proponents of the theory that successful host-parasite relationships adapt in the direction of benignity, actually discussed it about 50 years ago: "If the microorganism causing an epidemic is susceptible to variations in the direction of higher virulence, then opportunities for rapid spread in susceptible persons will cause an apparent increase in virulence by selection of the fittest, i.e. most virulent, bacteria" (The Natural History of Infectious Disease. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 1953). </p><p> This book has a somewhat self-congratulatory tone -- the author likes to assert that he made predictions and then to congratulate himself for having been right, as in the case of an accurate prediction that the Spanish influenza strain would not reappear during the 1990s. That a population becomes susceptible to the epidemic spread of an infection because acquired immunity has waned does not necessarily mean that the pathogen is still sitting there, waiting to reinfect people. </p><p> There are also some errors and misinterpretations in this book. For example, Ewald asserts that the transmission of genital herpesvirus infections is caused by stress, which induces the replication of the virus, the formation of blisters, and the subsequent transmission of the virus from lesions. The current understanding, however, is that inapparent infection and the asymptomatic shedding of virus are probably responsible for transmission in most cases. In trachoma, blindness is not caused by "puffiness" of the conjunctiva but is, rather, secondary to the scarring of the conjunctiva. Genital chlamydial infections (with secretions, Ewald supposes, contaminating the garments of persons in areas where trachoma is endemic) are not considered to have a role in the transmission of trachoma. The model Ewald presents of the replication of human papillomavirus in his discussion of cervical cancer probably has little relevance for the actual transmission of that virus. Young, sexually active women have very high rates of inapparent infection, and long-lasting dysplasia reflects a persistence of infection. That women with multiple sexual partners have a higher prevalence of infection with the "high-risk" types of human papillomavirus need not reflect increased virulence (there is no evidence of changes in the virulence of specific types of the virus); it can, instead, be easily explained by increased exposure and the more persistent nature of the infection caused by these types of the virus. The bottom line: an important subject, a disappointing book. </p><p> <i>Julius Schachter, Ph.D.</i> <br>Copyright � 2001 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

In it, some of the best international specialists working on the subject today examine terrorism's long and complex history from antiquity to the present day and find that terror, long the weapon of the weak against the strong, is a tactic as old as warfare itself. Beginning with the Zealots of Antiquity, the contributors discuss the Assassins of the Middle Ages, the 1789 Terror movement in Europe, Bolshevik terrorism during the Russian Revolution, Stalinism, "resistance" terrorism during World War II, and Latin American revolutionary movements of the late 1960s. Finally, they consider the emergence of modern transnational terrorism, focusing on the roots of Islamic terrorism, al Qaeda, and the rise of the contemporary suicide martyr. Along the way, they provide a groundbreaking analysis of how terrorism has been perceived throughout history. What becomes powerfully clear is that only through deeper understanding can we fully grasp the present dangers of a phenomenon whose repercussions are far from over.<br><br>Includes essays by Fran�ois G�r�, Rohan Gunaratna, Olivier Hubac-Occhipinti, Ariel Merari, Philippe Migaux, Yves Ternon</p><p><b>G�rard Chaliand</b> is an independent scholar who has held visiting professorships at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Harvard University.

Yet the great majority of Sephardi Jews, after their expulsion from Spain in 1492 and subsequently from Portugal, found their way to this region, drawn by the political stability and relatively tolerant rule of the Ottoman Empire, as well as by promising socioeconomic conditions. Esther Benbassa and Aron Rodrigue show how Sephardi society and culture developed in the Levant, sharing language, religion, customs, and communal life as they did nowhere else, both during prosperous times and during the declining fortunes of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The impact of westernization, the end of Ottoman power, and the rise of fragmenting nation-states transformed this vital community in the modern era. And, like many other Jewish communities, the unique Judeo-Spanish culture was dispersed and destroyed by the Holocaust and the migrations of the twentieth century. <i>Sephardi Jewry</i> presents its vivid history in a readable, well-documented narrative.</p><p>Praise for the French edition:<p><br><br>"The most complete and thorough historical synthesis ever written in a European language on the Jewish communities of the Balkans and Turkey."&#x2015;Michel Abitbol, <i>L'arche</i><br><br>"A rich and too-little-known history that successfully avoids twin snares: the myth of the irreparable decadence of oriental Judaism and the myth of the lost golden age of Spain."&#x2015;Alain Dieckhoff, <i>Les Nouveaux Cahiers</i><br><br>"The authors illuminate the variety of responses--between the poles of westernizing and holding onto tradition--offered by these Jewish societies of the Levantine Sephardi cultural area to the processes of modernization, as well as their startling receptivity to the new ideologies of zionism and socialism that marked the end of the nineteenth century." &#x2015;<i>Annales</i></p><b>Esther Benbassa</b> is Professor of Jewish History at the Universit� de Paris IV, Sorbonne, and Director of Research at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique.

Lawrence O.

A. Lloyd proposes a radically distinct interpretation of Hobbes&#39;s Leviathan that shows transcendent interests - interests that override the fear of death - to be crucial to both Hobbes&#39;s analysis of social disorder and his proposed remedy to it. Most previous commentators in the analytic philosophical tradition have argued that Hobbes thought that credible threats of physical force could be sufficient to deter people from political insurrection. Professor Lloyd convincingly shows that because Hobbes took the transcendence of religious and moral interests seriously, he never believed that mere physical force could ensure social order. Lloyd&#39;s interpretation demonstrates the ineliminability of that half of Leviathan devoted to religion, and attributes to Hobbes a much more plausible conception of human nature than the narrow psychological egoism traditionally attributed to Hobbes.</p><p>Hobbes&#39; Leviathan is arguably the greatest piece of political philosophy written in the English language.

In Fear of Knowledge, Paul Boghossian tears these relativist theories of knowledge to shreds. He argues forcefully for the intuitive, common-sense view-that the world exists independent of human opinion and that there is a way to arrive at beliefs about the world that are objectively reasonable to anyone capable of appreciating the relevant evidence, regardless of their social or cultural perspective. This short, lucid, witty book shows that philosophy provides rock-solid support for common sense against the relativists; it is provocative reading throughout the discipline and beyond.</p><p>Paul Boghossian is at New York University.<br>"This is a book that can be read in an afternoon and thought about for a lifetime. His analysis is something of a tour de force: subtle and original enough to attract the attention of professional philosophers but accessible enough to be read by anyone with an interest in the subject. The result is one of the most readable works in philosophy in recent years."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"The book does a fine job of assessing in brief compass the sort of relativism/constructivism advocated by Rorty and his fellow travelers, and Boghossian's sophisticated and careful arguments against that Rortian view are often ingenious and invariably telling. Aimed at non-specialists, <em>Fear of</em> <em>Knowledge</em> may well succeed in distancing those who are enamored of 'postmodern relativism'. . . from their postmodern enthusiasms."--Harvey Siegel, <em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Boghossian has written an excellent book.... it contains relentless exposures of confusion, falsehood, and incoherence."--John R.

Subsequent generations have struggled with its bold confrontation of violence but in the 20th and 21st centuries the play has chimed with audiences again, perhaps because of its simultaneously shocking and playful approach to violent revenge and bodily mutilation. Jonathan Bate's original Arden edition was first published in 1995 and has had a significant influence on how the play has been performed and studied in the past 20 years. This revised edition includes a new 10,000 word introductory essay in which Bate reassess his views on the play's co-authorship with George Peele in the light of contemporary textual scholarship and updates his lively account of the play's performance history, on the international stage and screen.

For this third edition, the editors write, nearly every entry has been changed significantly, and 162 entries have been added.

Dazzling in its genius and breadth, the long line of European and American intellectual discourse tells a remarkable story--a quest for truth and wisdom that continues to shape our most basic ideas about human nature and the world around us. That quest is brilliantly brought to life in <em>The Oxford History of Western Philosophy</em>.<br> Featuring hundreds of spectacular illustrations--including sixteen pages of full-color plates--this splendidly written volume takes the reader on a magnificient chronological tour through the revolutions of thought that have forged the Western philosophical tradition from ancient times to the present. Throughout, the six contributors--an internationally renowned team of philosophers including Roger Scruton, Anthony Quinton, and Anthony Kenny--bring the astonishingly diverse, wide-ranging landscape of intellectual history into sharp focus, emphasizing how notions seen today as part of an inevitable march of ideas were in their own time often considered radical, if not revolutionary. Thus we are treated, for example, to lively accounts of how Plato's "theory of forms" and Aristotle's pioneering exercises in logic broke with the past to irrevocably alter the course of Western thought. The authors also reveal the relationships between landmark thinkers, and the ways they drew on their intellectual heritage. They show, for instance, how St. Augustine and Aquinas, though advancing the cause of Christian doctrine, picked up where their pagan Greek forebears had left off. We witness how, during the Renaissance, the profound empiricist ideas underlying Descarte's famous utterance--"I think, therefore I exist"--lived in a tense but complementary relationship with Locke's rationalist theories. Moving into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the book explores how Hume greatly influenced Kant's conception of the "transcendental aesthetic," and how Hegel drew upon the lesser known (but groundbreaking) work of Fichte and Schelling. The authors bring the story up to our own time, vividly recounting the existential trend from Nietzsche ("God is dead") to Sartre, along with other increasingly fractious schools of thought. Along the way, we not only encounter the vast intellectual riches of the Western mind, but we also meet the personalities behind the great thoughts, from the saintly Hume (described by Adam Smith as having "come as near to perfection as anybody could") to the ill-mannered outcast Fichte. And the hundreds of maps and striking illustrations (including full-color reproductions of art ranging from medieval manuscripts to the works of Raphael, Ingres, and Magritte) form an integral part of the book, revealing the interweaving of art and ideas through the ages, as artists have striven to give visual immediacy to philosophical concepts.<br> <em>The Oxford History of Western Philosophy</em> is the most authoritative single-volume account ever written for the general reader. Engagingly written and astonishingly far-reaching, it provides the consummate introduction to the intellectual bedrock upon which Western civilization is built.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> <strong>Anthony Kenny</strong> is Warden of Rhodes House, Oxford University.<br>Malt may do more than Milton can to justify God's ways to man, but St. Augustine and the rest keep trying to entice us from the taverns to the scriptoria to explain the ways the world works. Oxford's roster of eminent excogitators ranges from Plato to Russell, as summarized by six exceptionally clear-writing teachers. In a subject of, commonly, impenetrable obtuseness and dubious utility to daily life, their essays are apt to pull in the layperson untrained in, but still intrigued by, philosophy's lineage. If the prose doesn't, the riot of illustrations must; there are hundreds, spanning Raphael's <i>School of Athens</i>, statues of Marx, and every thinker in between. Editor Kenny, who takes on the Enlightenment in "Descartes to Kant," divvies up the duties amongst the ancients, the medievals, continental philosophers like Hegel, Nietzsche, and Sartre, and the English analyticals (Bentham and Mill), followed by a survey of political philosophies. As a group, the writers excel at showing how erroneous ideas went wrong, as well as the varieties of explanations for existence, sense, linguistics, and morality.

Communication is an interactive process dependent on both speaking and listening. Too often, the listening part is given short shrift, and we are left wondering why we feel "empty." Defining listening as "the willingness to see a situation through the eyes of the speaker," Shafir goes beyond the mechanics of good listening behavior to an approach requiring relaxation, focus, and a desire to learn from the speakers' perspective. In a friendly and informal tone, she discusses specific exercises, activities, and strategies to improve awareness, provides illustrations, and gives examples from her clinical experiences.

Originally written to define the relation between the theories of transfinite numbers and mathematical games, the resulting work is a mathematically sophisticated but eminently enjoyable guide to game theory. By defining numbers as the strengths of positions in certain games, the author arrives at a new class, the surreal numbers, that includes both real numbers and ordinal numbers.

They may also manifest on a personal or even global level to convey demons, fear, or anxieties. In a broader sense, shadows signify unresolved trauma and bring it to the forefront of our consciousness as aspects of ourselves that we can finally acknowledge&#x2014;the skeletons, mummies, spiders, bats, crows, and ghosts we hide. This Tarot deck and accompanying guidebook provide you with the vital creative tools you need to access your shadows and reveal hidden truths. Alongside traditional Tarot symbolism and meanings, shadow aspects of our archetypal personalities are portrayed as 78 playful and quirky ink-and-watercolor creature cards that offer insight and guidance into our deepest selves. The book consists of a detailed introduction to shadows and shadow work, card meanings, reflection questions, and easy-to-follow spreads to help you discover, contemplate, and integrate previously unacknowledged aspects of your life and personality. For beginners as well as seasoned readers and shadow workers, discover imaginative solutions to everyday challenges as well as complex or concealed conditions.

Many of the major philosophical movements of the twentieth century - from existentialism to analytic philosophy - grew out of reactions against Hegel. He is also one of the hardest philosophers to understand and his complex ideas, though rewarding, are often misunderstood. <br><br>In this magisterial and lucid introduction, Frederick Beiser covers every major aspect of Hegel's thought. He places Hegel in the historical context of nineteenth-century Germany whilst clarifying the deep insights and originality of Hegel's philosophy.<br><br>A masterpiece of clarity and scholarship, <em>Hegel</em> is both the ideal starting point for those coming to Hegel for the first time and essential reading for any student or scholar of nineteenth century philosophy.<br><br>Additional features:</p> <ul> <li>glossary</li> <li>chapter summaries</li> <li>chronology</li> <li>annotated further reading.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Frederick Beiser</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Syracuse University.

The result is in my judgment little short of a triumph.

His work has affected the teaching of any number of disciplines and remains, twenty years after his death, critically important. This newly available edition is drawn from the complete collection of all of Foucault&#x2019;s courses, articles, and interviews, and brings his most important work to a new generation of readers. <em>Aesthetics, Method and Epistemology</em> (edited by James D. Faubion) surveys Foucault&#x2019;s diverse but sustained address of the historical forms and interplay of passion, experience, and truth.</p><br></p><p>Michel Foucault (1926&#x2013;1984) was one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. He held a chair in the history of systems of thought at the Coll�ge de France and lectured at universities throughout the world. The New Press has published his books <em>Aesthetics, Method, and Epistemology</em>; <em>Ethics</em>; <em>Power</em>; <em>The Essential Foucault</em>; and <em>The Chomsky-Foucault Debate</em> (with Noam Chomsky). Foucault&#x2019;s other books include <em>Madness and Civilization</em>, <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, <em>The Order of Things</em>, and <em>The History of Sexuality</em>.<br><br>James D. Faubion is a professor of anthropology at Rice University. He is the author of <em>The Shadows and Lights of Waco </em>and <em>Modern Greek Lessons</em> and the editor of Michel Foucault&#x2019;s <em>Aesthetics, Method, and Epistemology</em> and <em>Power</em>, both available from The New Press.The second of three volumes (following Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth, LJ 3/15/97) to be excerpted from the Gallimard collection of Foucault's oeuvre, this work provides American readers with diverse lectures, literary and film reviews, and interviews concerning language, literature, authorship, imagination, psychology, order, and history. At midpoint in the volume, the lecture "What is an author?" fairly describes the project of this series: "Writing unfolds like a game that invariably goes beyond its own rules and transgresses its limits." Each of these pieces is thoroughly self-contained but significant to a greater understanding of both its subject and its author. Wittily, one piece included here is Foucault's pseudonymously authored biographical dictionary entry on himself.

"I like it a lot. It is better than any other book I've ever used for these courses, and it's a lot better than some of them."<br><br>"I have used this text in Applied Calculus I and Applied Calculus II for one academic year and part of another. I have looked at similar texts that are essentially of a traditional nature with some limited inclusion of technology. In that genre of texts, this book is, in my opinion, near the top of the heap. The exposition and development of topics is good. The book is sufficiently precise in defining the key concepts of calculus. The examples are clear and illustrative. From the perspective of a traditional, algebraic approach to the subject, this text is excellent, with a bevy of supporting exercises." "The exposition in the text is very clear and appropriately geared towards our audience. I feel that the text has been carefully and thoughtfully written." "The worked examples are very thorough and cover enough steps and provide adequate exposition for students to find reading the examples worthwhile."

Highly authoritative, this new book covers not only Greek mythologies and Roman festivals, but also devotes attention to topics such as Greek and Roman religious places, monuments, authors and texts, religious organization, imagery, divination, astrology, and magic. Unlike many other references on ancient Greece and Rome, the <em>Dictionary</em> also includes many entries on Judaism and Christianity in the classical world.<br> The editors, area advisors for the third edition of the <em>Oxford Classical Dictionary</em>, have selected, revised, edited, and in some instances completely recast a large number of entries from the <em>OCD</em> to create this handy and accessible reference. The main text is supplemented by an important introductory essay providing overviews of mythology, religious pluralism in the ancient world, and the reception of myths from antiquity to the present. In addition to a helpful thematic index and extensive cross-references, the text is further supported by three maps and six genealogies.<br> Backed by the authority and scholarly rigor of the renowned <em>Oxford Classical Dictionary</em>, <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion</em> is a valuable A-Z reference and is as ideal a tool for students and teachers of ancient history as it is for all classics lovers.<br></p><p><br><strong>Simon Price</strong> has been teaching Ancient History at Oxford since 1981 and is the author of numerous books on religion in ancient Greece and Rome. He has worked extensively on ancient religions, primarily Greek and Roman, but he is also interested in the relations between those religions and Judaism and Christianity. <strong>Emily Kearns</strong> has held various teaching appointments in Oxford and London since 1990 and has been lecturer in Classical Languages and Literature at St. Hilda's College, Oxford.<br>The content of this encyclopedia is a selection of entries from the third edition of <i>The Oxford Classical Dictionary</i> (3d ed., 1996). The entries are broad in range, covering not just mythology but also "religious places and religious officials, divination, astrology, and magic." In addition, there are many entries on Judaism and Christianity, providing broader context to religious life in the Greco-Roman world.<p>Although entries have been taken from <i>The Oxford Classical Dictionary</i>, changes have been made. Some entries have been shortened. Untransliterated Greek, references to ancient texts within the body of an entry, and what the editors term obscure language have been deleted. Supplemental bibliographies have also been eliminated, although entries for individuals (e.g., <i>Hecuba</i>, <i>poseidon</i>) often conclude with some references to their appearance in ancient texts by such authors as Homer, Hesiod, and Livy. The work also includes a short annotated bibliography to serve as a guide for further reading. An introductory essay describes local, Panhellenic, and Roman myths and their reception throughout history. A thematic index groups entries by broad subject area (e.g., "Gods and Heroes," "Places"), and there are <i>see</i> references throughout the work. A few maps serve as the only illustrations.</p><p>Libraries owning <i>The Oxford Classical Dictionary</i> will not gain much by purchasing <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion</i>. The elimination of much of the scholarly content may diminish its usefulness to academic collections. On the other hand, some public and high-school libraries may find the work more accessible and thus of greater benefit. In this case, consideration ought to be given first to the <i>Cassell Dictionary of Classical Mythology</i> (1998). Although its scope is somewhat narrower, the entries are thorough, scholarly, and accessibly written; there are many illustrations; and the scholarly apparatus of references to ancient texts and other supplemental material is unobtrusively included for those wishing to pursue their research further. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Can healers simply lay their hands on ailing patients and make them well? How does sacred healing work and why?</p><p>"Today, a spiritual revival is gaining momentum and sacred healing is reaching its greatest acceptance since the Reformation," writes C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D., in <i>Sacred Healing</i>. As managed care makes modern medicine more and more impersonal, we are driven to recapture a sense of spiritual connection with our healing, says Shealy, a neurosurgeon, founder of the American Holistic Medicine Association, and author of many alternative-medicine books. Here Shealy explores miraculous healing, which goes beyond and cannot be explained by conventional medicine. He presents a brief history of healing, healers, and beliefs about spiritual healing. Then he explains why "sacred healing should be the treatment of choice when orthodox medicine has nothing to offer," and an ancillary treatment in conjunction with surgery and drugs at other times. He describes some modern spiritual healers, such as Harry Edwards, Olga Worrall, and Ostad Hadi Parvarandeh, and the feats of several psychic surgeons who achieve healing miracles. This is not a self-help book--you won't get practical tips or guidelines for using these concepts in your own life--but it does provide a context of sacred healing, the role of spirituality and faith in healing, and related topics such as electromagnetism. This book is not an easy read: the organization and writing style are not as reader-friendly as they might be. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><h2>An Introduction to the History of Mathematics</h2><p>This classic best-seller by a well-known author introduces mathematics history to math and math education majors.

Covering the country's history from the founding of the English colonies up through the latest decisions of the Supreme Court, this two-volume work presents the most complete discussion of American constitutional history currently available. Reflecting the latest in contemporary scholarship, the authors successfully blend cases and court doctrines into the larger fabric of American political, economic, and social history. They discuss in detail the great cases handed down by the Supreme Court, showing how these cases played out in society and how constitutional growth parallels changes in American culture. In addition, this two-volume set examines lesser-known decisions that played important roles in affecting change, and also contains in-depth analyses of the intellects and personalities of the Supreme Court justices who made these influential decisions.<br> This second edition of <em>A March of Liberty</em> addresses recent scholarship on race and gender, covers both constitutional and legal history, and examines federal, state, and private law. The text exemplifies the current trends in American constitutional history through its holistic approach of integrating the decisions of the state and lower federal courts with the decisions of the Supreme Court. Volume II addresses Reconstruction to the present and covers key issues including police power, criminal law, income tax, child labor, desegregation, school prayer, and foreign policy. It also examines control over issuing legal tender and control of and limits on conducting commerce.<br> <em>A March of Liberty, 2/e</em>, features useful supplemental materials including the text of the Constitution, a chronological list of Supreme Court justices, and suggested further readings.

She formerly served as curator of education at the Detroit Institute of Arts and head of education at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.Rivera portrayed himself in his memoirs as a revolutionary firebrand and visionary artist who repudiated his ties to European art in favor of a new style of mural painting. Yet the essays in this catalogue prove that the Mexican artist fused Cubist space with Futurist movement in epic murals molded from his study of Italian Renaissance frescoes and pre-Colombian sculpture. The first major retrospective of Rivera's works, mounted at the Detroit Institute of Arts, shows that there was much more to Rivera than his murals. Penetrating portraits, soul-baring self-portraits, sensitive nudes and cityscapes, and studies of Indian women are among the pictures reproduced here in 200 color and 325 black-and-white plates. Rivera's travels in the U.S. inspired paintings and drawings which drew on Aztec cosmology to explain industrial society in terms of universal order. Rivera's reputation has declined over the years, his art dismissed by some as leftist propaganda. But the essays in this outstanding album establish that his mural style is miles apart from socialist realism, and the contributors question the superficial distinction between "high" and "folk" art. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Urban Sketching Handbook 101 Sketching Tips: Tricks, Techniques, and Handy Hacks for Sketching on the Go (Volume 8) (Urban Sketching Handbooks, 8)</h2><p><b>Master the challenges of drawing on location with this collection of insider know-how and expert tips and techniques.</b><br><br> Illustrator, architect, and international workshop instructor and Urban Sketcher Stephanie Bower has collected <b>101 of her best insider drawing tips, hacks, and techniques</b> and shares them in this fully illustrated, portable book.

Tanner (1859&#x2013;1937). Recognized as the patriarch of African American artists, Tanner forged a path to international success, powerfully influencing younger black artists who came after him. Following a preface by David Driskell, the essays in this book&#x2015;written by international scholars including Alan Braddock, Michael Leja, Jean-Claude Lesage, Richard Powell, Marc Simpson, Tyler Stovall, and H�l�ne Valance&#x2015;explore many facets of Tanner&#x2019;s life, including his upbringing in post&#x2013;Civil War Philadelphia, his background as the son of a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal church, and his role as the first major academically trained African American artist. Additional essays discuss Tanner&#x2019;s expatriate life in France, his depictions of the Holy Land and North Africa, and the scientific and technical innovations reflected in his oeuvre. Edited and introduced by Anna O. Marley, this volume expands our understanding of Tanner&#x2019;s place in art history, showing that his status as a painter was deeply influenced by his race but not decided by it. <br><br>Contributors: Brian Baade, Alan Braddock, Marcus Bruce, Adrienne L. Childs, Robert Cozzolino, David Driskell, Amber Kerr-Allison, Michael Leja, Jean-Claude Lesage, Anna O. Marley, Olivier Meslay, Richard Powell, Marc Simpson, Tyler Stovall, H�l�ne Valance</p><p>&#x201c;This book constitutes a very welcome contribution to the public appreciation and scholarly study of Henry Ossawa Tanner, a painter of considerable significance in both Europe and America, and one whose religious imagery merits careful consideration. These well-researched essays by an international team of scholars offer substantial reflections on complex issues of race and religion, and situate the artist&#x2019;s work and career within the context of his life and times. This is a robust framing of Tanner as a cultural phenomenon and one that readers will find quite rewarding.&#x201d;&#x2015;David Morgan, Professor of Religion at Duke University and author of <i>The Embodied Eye: Religious Visual Culture and the Social Life of Feeling</i><br>&#x201c;Henry Ossawa Tanner has finally been recognized as an important artist in the last twenty years, and is now firmly part of the American canon as the first major African American painter to emerge from the academy. This book enriches our understanding of Tanner&#x2019;s historic place in American art by considering his work as an early modernist religious artist&#x2015;a status entwined with his race, but not defined by it. These essays, by an impressive collection of scholars, are full of substantially new material, and succeed in broadening our conception of Tanner&#x2019;s life and work.&#x201d;&#x2015;Bruce Robertson, Professor of Art and Architecture at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br><br><b>Anna O.

The last decade has seen the emergence of a vast quantity of data on the subject and there is now a perceived need among both teachers and undergraduate students for a new textbook that incorporates the numerous recent advances made in the field. The book is intended for use by advanced level undergraduate and beginning graduate students, taking related courses in wider ecology degree programmes. <br> <ul> <li>Very few books cover this subject and those that do are out of date.</li> </ul></p><p>Ever since Darwin&#x2019;s depiction on the final page of The Origin of Species of a tangled bank teeming with plants and animals, the importance of species interactions in molding their ecology ad evolution has become ever more apparent. Attraction, deception, attack, defense, escape and tolerance- all are core terms of evolutionary ecology that convey the central role of interactions. The diversity of structure, behavior, psychology, and ecology among plants and animals reflects the outcomes of antagonistic and mutually beneficial relationships. In fact, much of the extraordinary diversity of plants and animals on the planet derives from their interactions.<br> <p>Plant-Animal Interactions: an evolutionary approach is intended for graduate and upper-level undergraduate courses. Following a general introduction emphasizing the role of interactions in the evolution of biodiversity, chapters are devoted to the fossil record-plant-animal interactions, herbivory by insects and vertebrates, seed predation, pollination and seed dispersal by animals, ant-plant interaction, and synthesis that describes emerging areas of study, including the pivotal role of plant-animal interactions in conservation biology.</p><b>Carlos M. Herrera</b> is an evolutionary ecologist who has worked mainly on plant-disperser and plant-pollinator interactions in Mediterranean habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. Most of his research centers on elucidating the relative significance of ecological, historical and evolutionary determinants in shaping current plant-animal interactions.<br> <p><b>Olle Pellmyr</b> is a revolutionary biologist whose research focuses on plant-animal interactions, with special emphasis on mutualism and co-evolution. Using phylogenetic and ecological approaches, he explores links between mircoevolutionary processes and microevolutionary patterns. A native of Sweden now residing in the USA, he has done field research in Europe, the Americas, Japan, Africa, and Melanesia.</p></p><h2>At Risk: Natural Hazards, People&#39;s Vulnerability and Disasters</h2><p><p>The term 'natural disaster' is often used to refer to natural events such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods. However, the phrase 'natural disaster' suggests an uncritical acceptance of a deeply engrained ideological and cultural myth. <em>At Risk</em> questions this myth and argues that extreme natural events are not disasters until a vulnerable group of people is exposed.</p> <p>The updated new edition confronts a further ten years of ever more expensive and deadly disasters and discusses disaster not as an aberration, but as a signal failure of mainstream 'development'. Two analytical models are provided as tools for understanding vulnerability. One links remote and distant 'root causes' to 'unsafe conditions' in a 'progression of vulnerability'. The other uses the concepts of 'access' and 'livelihood' to understand why some households are more vulnerable than others. </p> <p>Examining key natural events and&nbsp;incorporating strategies to create a safer world, this revised edition is an important resource for those involved in the fields of environment and development studies.</p></p><p>Ben Wisner is Research Fellow at the Development Studies Institute, London School of Economics, and Affiliate Researcher on the Environmental Studies Program at Oberlin College, Ohio.<br>Piers Blaikie is Professor of Development Studies at the University of East Anglia.<br>Terry Cannon is Senior Lecturer in Geography and Development Studies at the University of Greenwich.<br>Ian Davis is Managing Director of the Oxford Centre for Disaster Studies."An excellent overview of the different human responses to natural hazards, dispelling the belief that little can be done to avoid the tragedies associated with natural hazards."<br>-Gareth Jones, University of Strathclyde <br>"Paradoxically in today's world safety coexists with risk.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

Until now, that hasn't been the case for Chinese Americans. From noted historian Mae Ngai, The Lucky Ones uncovers the three-generational saga of the Tape family. It's a sweeping story centered on patriarch Jeu Dip's (Joseph Tape's) self-invention as an immigration broker in post-gold rush, racially explosive San Francisco, and the extraordinary rise it enables. Ngai's portrayal of the Tapes as the first of a brand-new social type--middle-class Chinese Americans, with touring cars, hunting dogs, and society weddings to broadcast it--will astonish. Again and again, Tape family history illuminates American history. Seven-year-old Mamie Tape attempts to integrate California schools, resulting in the landmark 1885 Tape v. Hurley. The family's intimate involvement in the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair reveals how the Chinese American culture brokers essentially invented Chinatown--and so Chinese culture--for American audiences. Finally, Mae Ngai reveals aspects--timely, haunting, and hopeful--of the lasting legacy of the immigrant experience for all Americans.<p></p> <br> <br> <p> <b>Photos of the Tepe Family from <i>The Lucky Ones</i></b> <br> <b>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</b> <br> </p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> Joseph Tape with his hunting rifle and bird dogs, San Francisco, c. 1880s </td> <td> <br> The Tape family (Joseph, Emily, Mamie, Frank, Mary), 1884 <br> </td> <td> <br> Mamie with children, Emily and Harold, and sister Emily, Portland, 1912 </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> Ruby Tape, 1912 </td> <td> <br> Gertrude and husband Herbert, Sunol, California, 1913 </td><td> <br> Gertrude with Florence Park and daughters, Pacific Grove, c. 1915 </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br><p>"<i>The Lucky Ones</i> is a model of historical scholarship.

Chang, Stanford Universit</b></p><p>"Mae Ngai's book is perfect! The multigenerational story of the Tape family's experience as immigrants, then as Chinese Americans, is well told and richly documented. This jazzlike tale captures the complex, contradictory improvisations of all who come to these shores in search of freedom and fulfillment. Ngai's account of the Tape family's bargains with old and new world denizens is an outstanding teaching text because she highlights the way in which 'Chinese-American' identity, at a critical point in U.S. history, exemplified and constituted 'American' citizenship and 'American' dreaming. Through Ngai's account, students are able to understand how very American the Tape family was and how similar their tale is, even in its difference, to those of other Americans."<b>--Lucas B.

E. Cummings (1894&#x2013;1962) was among the most influential, widely read, and revered modernist poets. He was also a playwright, a painter, and a writer of prose. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he studied at Harvard University and, during World War I, served with an ambulance corps in France. He spent three months in a French detention camp and subsequently wrote The Enormous Room, a highly acclaimed criticism of World War I. After the war, Cummings returned to the States and published his first collection of poetry, Tulips &amp; Chimneys, which was characterized by his innovative style: pushing the boundaries of language and form while discussing love, nature, and war with sensuousness and glee. He spent the rest of his life painting, writing poetry, and enjoying widespread popularity and success.</p><h2>The War of the Worlds (Illustrated 1898 Edition): 100th Anniversary Collection</h2><p><b>A beautiful and rare edition that includes 130 illustrations by Henrique Correa</b><br><b>SeaWolf Press</b> is proud to offer another book in its <b>H.

It is one of the earliest stories to detail a conflict between mankind and an extraterrestrial race. The novel is the first-person narrative as southern England is invaded by Martians who possess devastating weapons. The novel has been variously interpreted as a commentary on evolutionary theory, British imperialism, and generally Victorian superstitions, fears, and prejudices. The story has also been made into a number of movies, TV shows, and radio dramas. It was most memorably dramatized in a 1938 radio program that caused public panic among listeners who did not know the Martian invasion was fictional. The novel has even influenced the work of rocket scientists in their quest to land on the moon.</p></p><p></p><h2>Suzanne Somers&#39; Eat, Cheat, and Melt the Fat Away: *Feast on Real Foods--Including Fats *Achieve Hormonal Balance *Enjoy More Than 100 New Recipes</h2><p>Find out how hundreds of thousands of people all across the country have melted the pounds away without dieting, without deprivation -- the Somersize way!<br><br>With her number one <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <b>Eat Great, Lose Weight</b> and <b>Get Skinny on Fabulous Food</b>, Suzanne Somers spread the word about her revolutionary weight-loss program that's unlike any diet out there.

When a flood ravages the countryside of the lower Mississippi, a convict finds himself adrift with a pregnant woman.

It&#39;s in Littleton, Colorado---not exactly the center of the universe, or anything else for that matter---more the southwestern edge of the Denver metro area. But on April 20, 1999---and for about a month after---Columbine seemed like the center of the universe, judging by news coverage. On that day two students came to school armed to the teeth and started shooting people. They killed 12 students, one teacher, and themselves in a bloody rampage. Until the felling of the World Trade Center towers in September 2001 there was, I suspect, never a more photographed crime scene. Like the terror on 9/11, the Columbine coverage was all from the outside---a crisis covered from every angle except the one where people were caught struggling between life and death. Jim Hancock: Ask a dozen youth workers about life beyond Columbine and you&#39;ll hear about tipping points, wake-up calls, and rumors of revival; about law enforcement cover-ups, gun control, and Michael Moore; about increased school security and purely cosmetic changes; about freaks, geeks, jocks, and bullies; about a terror notable mainly for its demographics (meaning the shooters and victims were mainly suburban and relatively affluent). Ask a youth worker on the south side of Chicago who met with his group on the evening of the massacre. He&#39;d tell you the adult leaders in his church followed the news from Littleton throughout the afternoon and arrived early to pray and prepare to deal with the trauma once students started showing up. What was truly shocking, he&#39;d say, was how little emotion there was of any sort---not anger, not fear, not even compassion. Kids were fooling around like it was just another Tuesday. He could hardly believe it. What emerged from the group as leaders tried to engage the students in talking about the shootings surprised him even more: What&#39;s the big deal? his students wondered. We feel bad for those people and all, but we have shootings in our community all the time. &#39;I got shot,&#39; a boy said, lifting his shirt to show the scar. &#39;My brother got killed,&#39; a girl said. And one by one the adults learned that every kid in the room was acquainted with violence and brutal death to a degree none of the leaders knew before that night. That youth worker would say he felt terrible for the Columbine families and he felt terrible for the children and families in his own church whose loss went unrecorded all those years because it was--- what? Less concentrated? Less affluent? Browner-skinned? (He wouldn&#39;t include that last question, but I certainly would.) So that&#39;s one version of life beyond Columbine; one where it would be nice to grieve the loss of strangers if we just had the emotional reserves. But most of us live well beyond Columbine, and, due respect, we have our own crises. Ask a youth worker who actually had kids at Columbine, and you may hear about outsiders swarming Littleton to profi t from the misery; about cameras, microphones, and relentless scrutiny; about quick in-and-out visits from fear-mongering and fund-raising Christian carpetbaggers who came mainly to talk about themselves. All these years later, the anger and sadness about those things are just under the surface for some folks, mixed with images and memories they can&#39;t quite believe another person would comprehend: Crouching behind a hardened police vehicle listening to gunfi re inside the school. Six, seven, eight, nine ambulances screaming out of a cul-de-sac, every one bearing injured students---23 in all. A fi reman hosing blood off the walkway of a house repurposed as a triage center. Walking about in a fog. Burying youth group kids. Working to exhaustion and sickness. Feeling guilty about an ordinary pleasure enjoyed for the fi rst time since the killing. RVP: Here&#39;s a story you maybe haven&#39;t heard: When all hell broke loose at the high school---and before, during, and after the outsiders came and went---there was a network of youth workers quietly looking after kids in Littleton and the communities that weave around it: Highlands Ranch. Southglenn. Greenwood Village. Cherry Hills. Englewood. Sheridan. Bow Mar. Ken Caryl. Columbine. It&#39;s always been a relational thing---this network, formalized only to the extent that we gave it a name---The Southwest Connection--- just so we&#39;d have something to call it. No Web site. No agenda. Just relationships with people who understand each other in the ebb and fl ow of ministry with kids and families. Youth workers in the Southwest Connection come from all over the theological and ecclesiological map: Baptist, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Bible church, Catholic, independent, nondenominational. They come to know each other as colleagues in ministry to students at a dozen or so high schools and probably twice that many middle schools. That&#39;s what&#39;s always drawn us together: Our love for kids. And shared space: 80123, give or take. With physical proximity, theological diversity, shared identity as youth workers, and the nurturing that blossoms when we come together, these remarkable people walked each other through the terror; finding each other here and there in the craziness and taking strength from the horrible, blessed realization this was really happening and we were not alone. In the process, we learned that relationships are everything in a crisis. It wasn&#39;t the public extravaganzas that helped; it was one person listening to another. It was off-sites with a few students. &#39;I suppose the big public meetings were helpful,&#39; one of my friends says, meaning most weren&#39;t very helpful at all. &#39;I mean they were well-produced and all, but what really helped was contact with people.&#39; His wife takes a softer tone toward the high profi le gatherings: &#39;Some of the big meetings gave groups of four and fi ve students a place to focus their attention on each other and process their experiences together.</p><h2>Death at an Early Age: The Classic Indictment of Inner-City Education</h2><p><b>WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD</b><br><br>In 1964, Jonathan Kozol entered the Boston Public School system to teach fourth grade at one of its most overcrowded inner-city schools.

With long lists of material to cover for the tests, teachers may soon find themselves with no time to venture beyond the official curriculum or to reach out to students. Kozol decries this kind of teaching. Indeed, his arguments about the need for teachers to know their students and link learning to their lives is at the heart of the book.

With only a circular medallion, a mysterious poem, and his own wits to guide him, he must find and rescue a missing king.</p><p>Cindy Neuschwander is an elementary school teacher who loves teaching math. She also enjoys traveling, reading, and writing stories. She thought up Sir Cumference while visiting medieval castles in England. Cindy lives in Pleasanton, California.Grades 1-4--Radius, the son of Sir Cumference and Lady Di of Ameter, ventures on a heroic quest to earn his knighthood. He first proves his ability to make a "knightly right angle," as Sir D'Grees has trained him, and then doubles the right angle to make a straight angle. So he is sent off with the family medallion, in the shape of a circle (cardboard medallion included), to rescue the missing King Lell. Falling bridges, a cryptic riddle, a crocodile-infested moat, and a winding labyrinth all must be mastered before finding the king and his twin dragons, known as "Pair of Lells." Sir Cumference has something to offer a wide range of readers. Some will be too young to understand the math and the word puns but will enjoy the story of a knight rescuing a king. Others will puzzle over the math and how to use the protractor (medallion) to solve the riddle. This group will be helped by the somewhat primitively painted pictures, which give clues to these angled decisions and enhance the story of a brave knight on his quest. Still other children will note the story, groan at the puns, and wish for more sophisticated illustrations. This book has a stronger story line than that found in most math books. It should be useful to creative teachers and fun for the right child.<p></p><p><i>Nancy A.

First, months of building interior pressure triggered a massive landslide, removing the entire north face of the mountain. This avalanche was followed immediately by a violent eruption that ultimately expelled over a quarter-billion cubic yards of magma. The blast devastated roughly 250 square miles, leaving behind scoured rock, millions of fallen trees, and mud-choked river valleys. Yet the land returned, gradually restoring and regenerating itself. Beginning in 1981 and continuing until 1990, photographer Frank Gohlke made regular visits to the devastated land around Mount St. Helens. This collection of photographs of biblical grandeur records both the ravaged terrain around the volcano in the early years after the eruption, and the regrowth--slow but extraordinary--of the region's natural forest. <i>Mount St. Helens: 1981 to 1990</i> contains a dramatic selection of these photographs; an introductory essay on the volcanology and geology of the Pacific Northwest by Kerry Sieh and Simon LeVay; and notes on the images by the photographer himself.</p><p></p><h2>Sanskrit Alphabet (Devanagari) Study Book Volume 2 Conjunct consonants &amp; Exercises on mantras and slokas</h2><p>This series of two books is designed for the systematic learning of Devanagari, the alphabet script generally used for written Sanskrit.

In this first-of-its-kind book, psychotherapist Jeanne Safer takes us into the hidden world of problem siblings and explores the far-reaching effects on the lives of those who are considered the &#x201c;normal ones.&#x201d;<br> <br>Drawing on more than sixty interviews with normal, or intact, siblings, Safer explores the daunting challenges they face, and probes the complex feelings that can strain families and damage lives. A &#x201c;normal&#x201d; sibling herself, Safer chronicles her own life-shaping experiences with her troubled brother. She examines the double-edged reality of normal ones: how they both compensate for their siblings&#x2019; abnormality and feel guilty for their own health and success. With both wisdom and empathy, she delineates the &#x201c;Caliban Syndrome,&#x201d; a set of personality traits characteristic of higher-functioning siblings: premature maturity, compulsion to achieve, survivor guilt, and fear of contagion.<br><br>Essential reading for normal ones and those who love them, this landmark work offers readers insight, compassion, and tools to help resolve childhood pain.

His extensive writings include Coming Through the Whirlwind. Dr. Eigen is in the private practice of psychoanalysis in New York City.'This book is a rich phenomenological and psychodynamic exploration of "the mad dimension of life", a discussion which has both breadth and depth. Eigen must certainly rank amongst the foremost of contemporary analytic therapists and theorists who are making significant steps in furthering our understanding of madness. Any clinician who has ever attempted to understand the thoughts and experiences of psychotic patients will find much that is illuminating and well described in this book.'- Phil Mollon in British Journal of Psychiatry'An extraordinary book. Reading The Psychotic Core not only becomes an excursion through the (universal) elements of psychosis, but evolves into an encounter with the psychotic process itself. Eigen is, however, fundamentally a psychoanalyst in his approach and method, and his analytic view constitutes both a framework for interpretation and a mode of knowing. By listening to psychosis, by understanding its presence, by looking at (and interpreting) its symbolizations, we enhance our knowledge of what it means to live in a historical project that finds itself affected by periodic eruptions of a cultural and political madness.'- James M. Glass in The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease'The Psychotic Core is one of the finest treatises I have ever read on the subject. It is solidly clinical and pragmatic on one hand, and yet it is a piece of exquisite, artistic phenomenology on the other. Eigen's concept of madness elegantly spans what we ordinarily mean by borderline states as well as the formal psychotic states. The work is a very creatively integrative one. The pigments on his palette include Freud, Jung, Bion, Winnicott, and many others.'- James Grotstein in Psychotherapy &amp; Social Science Review</p><h2>Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings</h2><p>This first truly multicultural anthology collects important, readable texts representative of the full range of social theory as it has developed from the nineteenth century to the present. Now that social theory is practiced in many disciplines, it is time to reflect on the variety of theories being read today <i>and</i> the earlier sources that are customarily neglected. If today we read Donna Haraway, Henry Louis Gates, and Michel Foucault, we should also read and understand Charlotte Perkins Gilman and W.E.B. Du Bois, alongside Weber, Simmel, William James, and others of their contemporaries from the end of the nineteenth century.This book, therefore, sets a wider gauge for the understanding of the history of social thought than could have been possible before. It brings texts together in unexpected and exciting ways: those of Parsons and Dorothy Smith, Merton and Lacan, Wallerstein and Frantz Fanon, James Coleman and Molefi Asante. Extensive introductory essays by the editor situate the writings in their times, identifying the currents of social change that shaped fundamental questions of modern and postmodern life.

While the authors' perspective is broad, they clearly state their assessment of what is important and what is not as they present the essence of macroeconomic theory today.The main purpose of <i>Lectures on Macroeconomics</i> is to characterize and explain fluctuations in output, unemployment and movement in prices. The most important fact of modern economic history is persistent long term growth, but as the book makes clear, this growth is far from steady. The authors analyze and explore these fluctuations.</p><p>Topics include consumption and investment; the Overlapping Generations Model; money; multiple equilibria, bubbles, and stability; the role of nominal rigidities; competitive equilibrium business cycles, nominal rigidities and economic fluctuations, goods, labor and credit markets; and monetary and fiscal policy issues. Each of chapters 2 through 9 discusses models appropriate to the topic. Chapter 10 then draws on the previous chapters, asks which models are the workhorses of macroeconomics, and sets the models out in convenient form. A concluding chapter analyzes the goals of economic policy, monetary policy, fiscal policy, and dynamic inconsistency.</p><p>Written as a text for graduate students with some background in macroeconomics, statistics, and econometrics, <i>Lectures on Macroeconomics</i> also presents topics in a self contained way that makes it a suitable reference for professional economists.</p></p><p>Lectures on Macroeconomics provides the first comprehensive description and evaluation of macroeconomic theory in many years.

While the conclusions reached by such critical scholarship are still matters of dispute, the inconsistencies which it has identified stand clearly before us and pose a serious challenge to the believer in divine revelation. How can a text marred by contradiction be the legacy of Sinai? How can there be reverence for holy scriptures that show signs of human intervention? David Weiss Halivni explores these questions, not by disputing the evidence itself or by defending the absolute integrity of the Pentateuchal words at all costs, but rather by accepting the inconsistencies of the text as such and asking how this text might yet be a divine legacy.Inconsistencies and unevenness in the Pentateuchal scriptures are not the discovery of modern textual science alone. Halivni demonstrates that the earliest stewards of the Torah, including some of those represented in the Bible itself, were aware of discrepancies within the tradition. From the Book of Chronicles through the commentaries of the Rabbis, sensitive readers have perceived maculations, which mitigate against the notion of an unblemished, divine document, and have responded to these maculations in different ways. <i>Revelation Restored</i> asserts that acknowledging and accounting for human intervention in the Pentateuchal text is not alien to the Biblical or Rabbinic tradition and need not belie the tradition of revelation. Moreover, it argues that through recognizing textual problems in the scriptures, as well as efforts to resolve them in tradition, we may learn not only about the nature of the Pentateuch itself but also about the ongoing relationship between its people and its source.</p><p><b>David Weiss Halivni</b> is Lucius N. Littauer Professor of Classical Jewish Civilization at Columbia University.

To them, these coverings seemed irrelevant to both modern life and Islamic piety. Today, however, the majority of Muslim women throughout the Islamic world again wear the veil. Why, Ahmed asks, did this change take root so swiftly, and what does this shift mean for women, Islam, and the West?</p><p>When she began her study, Ahmed assumed that the veil's return indicated a backward step for Muslim women worldwide. What she discovered, however, in the stories of British colonial officials, young Muslim feminists, Arab nationalists, pious Islamic daughters, American Muslim immigrants, violent jihadists, and peaceful Islamic activists, confounded her expectations. Ahmed observed that Islamism, with its commitments to activism in the service of the poor and in pursuit of social justice, is the strain of Islam most easily and naturally merging with western democracies' own tradition of activism in the cause of justice and social change. It is often Islamists, even more than secular Muslims, who are at the forefront of such contemporary activist struggles as civil rights and women's rights. Ahmed's surprising conclusions represent a near reversal of her thinking on this topic.</p><p>Richly insightful, intricately drawn, and passionately argued, this absorbing story of the veil's resurgence, from Egypt through Saudi Arabia and into the West, suggests a dramatically new portrait of contemporary Islam.</p></p><p><p><b>Leila Ahmed</b> is the Victor S.

The grey towers of Baskerville Hall and the wild open country of Dartmoor hold many secrets for Holmes and Watson to unravel. The detective is contemptuous of supernatural manifestations, but the reader will remain perpetually haunted by the hound from the moor.</p><p>We owe 1902's <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher "Bobbles" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's "a real Creeper!" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. "The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul," Watson realizes. "Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths." Read on--but, reader, watch your step! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>For generations the curse had hung over the Baskerville family. Now another life had been claimed by the mysterious and terrifying beast. Was it a demon or an animal lurking on the descolate moor? Would the new master of the Baskerville home be its next victim?<p></p><p>Sherlock Holmes and Watson set out to solve the most bewildering and bloodcurdling case of their careers in this world-famous classic of mystery and suspense.</p></p><h2>East of the Sun and West of the Moon: Old Tales from the North (Illustrated by Kay Nielsen)</h2><p>Kay Nielsen, one of the most famous children&#39;s book illustrators of all time, will delight children and adults, with this his masterpiece. The stories he illustrated were gathered by famed folklorists and inseparable friends, Peter Christen Asbj�rnsen and J�rgen Moe who were the Norwegian Brothers Grimm, travelling the length of Norway in search of folktales. Their stories are &#34;the never-failing springs of sentiment, of sensation, of heroic example, from which primeval peoples drank their fill at will.&#34; (Fully illustrated in black and white.)</p><p></p><h2>Making Rumours: The Inside Story of the Classic Fleetwood Mac Album</h2><p><b>Inside the making of one of the biggest-selling albums of all time: Fleetwood Mac's <i>Rumours</i></b><p>Fleetwood Mac's classic 1977 <i>Rumours</i> album topped the Billboard 200 for thirty-one weeks and won the Album of the Year Grammy. More recently, Rolling Stone named it the twenty-fifth greatest album of all time and the hit TV series Glee devoted an entire episode to songs from <i>Rumours</i>, introducing it to a new generation. Now, for the first time, Ken Caillat, the album's co-producer, tells the full story of what really went into making <i>Rumours</i>&#x2014;from the endless partying and relationship dramas to the creative struggles to write and record ""You Make Loving Fun,"" ""Don't Stop,"" ""Go Your Own Way,"" ""The Chain,"" and other timeless tracks.</p><ul><li>Tells the fascinating, behind-the-music story of the making of Fleetwood Mac's <i>Rumours</i>, written by the producer who saw it all happen </li><li>Filled with new and surprising details, such as Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham's screaming match while recording ""You Make Loving Fun,"" how the band coped with the pressures of increasing success, how the master tape nearly disintegrated, and the incredible attention paid to even the tiniest elements of songs, from Lindsey playing a chair to Mick breaking glass </li><li>Includes eighty black-and-white photographs </li></ul></p><p><br>"Rumours by Fleetwood Mac - the album absolutely changed my life, and yours, too. Containing brilliant songs byLindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie, it's a classic among classics. Producer Ken Caillat has a brilliant book coming out on the making of Rumours, but ahead of its release, he spoke to me about how he tracked the mega disc cut-by-cut."<br><br><b>Joe Bosso<br>US Editor, MusicRadar</b>&nbsp;c<p>Rumours generated four top-ten singles, topped the Billboard album charts for thirty-one weeks, and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1977. It went on to become the fifth bestselling album to date&#x2014;forty million copies and counting&#x2014;and Rolling Stone's twenty-fifth greatest album of all time. And it turned a band that had struggled to make a name for itself for nearly two decades into a household name. In Making Rumours, the album's coproducer Ken Caillat tells the wild, poignant, and exhilarating story behind the album's creation. Its potent combination of rock-star melodrama, technical insights, and compelling portraits of five brilliant but troubled young artists at their creative peak will forever change the way you hear the album. </p><p>Trouble was brewing well before sessions began at the Record Plant in Sausalito in January 1976. John and Christine McVie were getting divorced. Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham had joined the band as a couple more than a year earlier, but now they were in a constant state of war. And, unknown to anyone but Caillat's coproducer, Richard Dashut, drummer Mick Fleetwood had just learned that his wife was divorcing him and taking up with his best friend.</p><p>From the first session, which featured the rudiments of "The Chain" and John McVie improvising the critical bass part that ties it all together, to the final sessions that tempered and polished the songs' vocals, Caillat reveals how these conflicts, fueled by drugs, alcohol, and the pressure of making the album, tore the band apart. But making the music pulled them back together. </p><p>Stevie and Lindsey had screaming matches between takes of "You Make Loving Fun," and John and Christine bickered constantly. During takes, however, everyone collaborated brilliantly and did whatever it took to get the sound they needed. Lindsey played a beat against a leather chair on "Second Hand News"; Mick stood atop a ladder, tossing sheets of glass to the floor for the haunting end of "Gold Dust Woman"; and Christine, at Ken's suggestion, took the stage in an empty theater to record her splendid "Songbird" vocal. </p><p>Woven through all of this drama and artistry, Caillat presents a virtual master class in how to produce a great album. He describes everything from microphone placement and how to liven up a "dead" room to how to work with difficult artists and what to do when your master tape begins to degrade nine months into the process.</p><p>Packed with scores of never-before-published photos from Caillat's personal collection, Making Rumours is a must-read for Fleetwood Mac fans, rock history buffs, and anyone who loves a behind-the-scenes account of great musicians at work and play.</p></p><h2>A History of Western Society, Volume 1: From Antiquity to Enlightenment</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p></p><h2>Venture Capital and Private Equity: A Casebook</h2><p>The 5th edition of Lerner's <i>Venture Capital and Private Equity: A Casebook</i> continues to present the important historical cases of private equity while incorporating a number of new relevant and timely cases from previous best-selling issues.

The author faces this challenge head-on by making a case for the important role of formative assessment in increasing teacher quality and student learning.<p> Formative assessment plays an important role in increasing teacher quality and student learning when it's viewed as a process rather than a tool. Emphasizing the instructional side of formative assessment, this book explores in-depth the use of classroom questioning, learning intentions and success criteria, feedback, collaborative and cooperative learning, and self-regulated learning to engineer effective learning environments for students.</p><p> <b>Benefits</b></p><p> * Presents five key strategies with research evidence to show the impact of each</p><p> * Includes over 50 practical techniques for classroom formative assessment</p><p></p><p>Contents <br>Introduction <br>Chapter 1: Why Educational Achievement Matters <br>Chapter 2: The Case for Formative Assessment <br>Chapter 3: Clarifying, Sharing, and Understanding Learning Intentions and Success Criteria <br>Chapter 4: Eliciting Evidence of Learners Achievement <br>Chapter 5: Providing Feedback That Moves Learning Forward <br>Chapter 6: Activating Students as Instructional Resources for One Another <br>Chapter 7: Activating Students as Owners of Their Own Learning <br>Epilogue <br>References and Resources</p></p><p>Dylan Wiliam, PhD, is a consultant who works with educators in North America, the United Kingdom, and many other countries to develop effective, research-based formative assessment practices.

Fortunately, Dylan Wiliam s wonderful new book strips away the murk currently surrounding formative assessment.

For today s educators, this is truly a must-read! --W. James Popham, Professor Emeritus, UCLA<br><br>Dylan Wiliam has done it again. With compelling evidence and more than three decades of research, Wiliam s most recent work confirms his place in the front rank of global thought leaders in education. Teachers and school leaders will find this work enormously practical. Policymakers will find it challenging, as Wiliam s case for formative assessment will confront many widely held misconceptions about the value of the rating, ranking, and sorting schools and teachers based upon summative assessments. I also hope that this book finds an audience among students both university students who aspire to be teachers and secondary school students who want to be part of the solution in improving a culture of test-based education. --Douglas Reeves, The Leadership and Learning Center<br><br>This is a must-have, must-read, must-put-into-immediate-action book for every teacher, principal, and network leader.

The first section of this collection pays homage to the poet's roots in a place where the world hands you nothing and promises less, so you are left to invent yourself or disappear. From there these poems both recount and embody repeated acts of defiant self-creation in the face of despair, loss, and shame, and always in the shadow of annihilation.<br><br>With darkly raucous humor and wrenching pathos, Seuss burrows furiously into liminal places of no dimension&#x2015; state lines, lakes' edges, the space "between the m and the e in the word amen." From what she calls "this place inbetween" come profane prayers in which "the sound of hope and the sound of suffering" are revealed to be "the same music played on the same instrument." <br><br>Midway through this book, a man tells the speaker that beauty is that which has not been touched. This collection is a righteous and fierce counterargument: in the world of this imagination, beauty spills from that which has been crushed, torn, and harrowed. "We receive beauty," Seuss writes, "as a nail receives / the hammer blow." This is the poetry that comes only after the white dress has been blown open&#x2015;the poetry of necessity, where a wild imagination is the only hope.</p><p>Diane Seuss is writer-in-residence at Kalamazoo College. Her first poetry collection, It Blows You Hollow, was published in 1998 by New Issues Press. Her poems have been published in several anthologies and in many literary magazines, including Poetry, <i>New Orleans Review</i>, <i>North American Review</i>, and <i>The Georgia Review</i>."In <i>Wolf Lake, White Gown Blown Open</i> we are introduced to a poetry both gentle and heart-breaking&#x2015;and ferocious. In these fractured, yet lyrical, narratives and voices, there is a remarkable new way of approaching the terrible clarity of beauty and horror in this world. Diane Seuss writes with the intensity of a soothsayer. These poems spring from the depths of a hypnotic sensibility. They exist in the best of the literary and oral traditions&#x2015;a love of language revealed in the use of all of its tools. Here is a poet vocalizing so much of what it means to be alive that I felt afraid at times to put the book down or to blink."&#x2015;Laura Kasischke, author of <i>In a Perfect World</i> and <i>Feathered</i><br><br>"For all its considerable invention, wit, tonal complexity, and vivid imagery&#x2015;not to mention its economy and concentration&#x2015;Diane Seuss's work is never content to settle for craft. There is an insistently human connection to experience in each of her poems."&#x2015;Stuart Dybek, author of <i>Streets in Their Own Ink</i><br><br>"Diane Seuss's poems take us to a place 'beyond the jurisdiction / of the sentence: (to) a secret place, bordered by lilacs.' I could say they were 'compelling' (they are astonishingly so). I could say this poet was 'the best poet of her generation' (she just might be).

This fully revised edition re-establishes Genetics for Cat Breeders as the text of choice in the field of feline genetics.</p><p>The field of genetics has changed considerably since the first edition of Genetics for Cat Breeders was published in 1971. For decades the discussion of genetics was limited to observations of populations but now geneticists are beginning to look at the actual molecular mechanisms behind the traits and diseases seen in the cat.Continuing the pioneering work of the late Roy Robinson, Carolyn Vella and her team of experts have significantly expanded the scope of previous editions to produce a work which is now of equal benefit to both veterinary surgeons and cat breeders. Their aim has been to make the book more accessible and understandable whilst providing an inpartial look at sometimes controversial and complex issues.The book retains the most important information published in previous editions and also incorporates some of the continuing work done by Roy Robinson prior to his death. A considerable amount of new information has been added in order to provide both breeders and veterinarians with the broadest possible range of information. The authors have not only reviewed the traditional sources of scientific literature and recently published studies, but have also conducted interviews with veterinarians, researchers and breeders.Robinson's Genetics for Cat Breeders &amp; Veterinarians 4th Edition is an essential purchase for all breeders of pedigreed cats, practicing small animal veterinarians and veterinary undergraduates.

Born into one of New York's elite families, she drew upon her knowledge of upper class aristocracy to realistically portray the lives and morals of the Gilded Age.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><i>THE BACKGROUND</i><br><br>Gute Gesellschaft hab ich gesehen; man nennt sie die gute Wenn sie zum kleinsten Gedicht nicht die Gelegenheit giebt.<br><br>Goethe: <i>Venezianische Epigrammen</i><br><br>1<br><br>It was on a bright day of midwinter, in New York. The little girl who eventually became me, but as yet was neither me nor anybody else in particular, but merely a soft anonymous morsel of humanity -- this little girl, who bore my name, was going for a walk with her father. The episode is literally the first thing I can remember about her, and therefore I date the birth of her identity from that day.<br><br>She had been put into her warmest coat, and into a new and very pretty bonnet, which she had surveyed in the glass with considerable satisfaction. The bonnet (I can see it today) was of white satin, patterned with a pink and green plaid in raised velvet. It was all drawn into close gathers, with a <i>bavolet</i> in the neck to keep out the cold, and thick ruffles of silky <i>blonde</i> lace under the brim in front. As the air was very cold a gossamer veil of the finest white Shetland wool was drawn about the bonnet and hung down over the wearer's round red cheeks like the white paper filigree over a Valentine; and her hands were encased in white woollen mittens.<br><br>One of them lay in the large safe hollow of her father's bare hand; her tall handsome father, who was so warm-blooded that in the coldest weather he always went out without gloves, and whose head, with its ruddy complexion and intensely blue eyes, was so far aloft that when she walked beside him she was too near to see his face. It was always an event in the little girl's life to take a walk with her father, and more particularly so today, because she had on her new winter bonnet, which was so beautiful (and so becoming) that for the first time she woke to the importance of dress, and of herself as a subject for adornment -- so that I may date from that hour the birth of the conscious and feminine <i>me</i> in the little girl's vague soul.<br><br>The little girl and her father walked up Fifth Avenue: the old Fifth Avenue with its double line of low brown-stone houses, of a desperate uniformity of style, broken only -- and surprisingly -- by two equally unexpected features: the fenced-in plot of ground where the old Miss Kennedys' cows were pastured, and the truncated Egyptian pyramid which so strangely served as a reservoir for New York's water supply. The Fifth Avenue of that day was a placid and uneventful thoroughfare, along which genteel landaus, broughams and victorias, and more countrified vehicles of the "carryall" and "surrey" type, moved up and down at decent intervals and a decorous pace. On Sundays after church the fashionable of various denominations paraded there on foot, in gathered satin bonnets and tall hats; but at other times it presented long stretches of empty pavement, so that the little girl, advancing at her father's side was able to see at a considerable distance the approach of another pair of legs, not as long but considerably stockier than her father's. The little girl was so very little that she never got much higher than the knees in her survey of grown-up people, and would not have known, if her father had not told her, that the approaching legs belonged to his cousin Henry. The news was very interesting, because in attendance on Cousin Henry was a small person, no bigger than herself, who must obviously be Cousin Henry's little boy Daniel, and therefore somehow belong to the little girl. So when the tall legs and the stocky ones halted for a talk, which took place somewhere high up in the air, and the small Daniel and Edith found themselves face to face close to the pavement, the little girl peered with interest at the little boy through the white woollen mist over her face. The little boy, who was very round and rosy, looked back with equal interest; and suddenly he put out a chubby hand, lifted the little girl's veil, and boldly planted a kiss on her cheek. It was the first time -- and the little girl found it very pleasant.<br><br>This is my earliest definite memory of anything happening to me; and it will be seen that I was wakened to conscious life by the two tremendous forces of love and vanity.<br><br>It may have been just after this memorable day -- at any rate it was nearly at the same time -- that a snowy-headed old gentleman with a red face and a spun-sugar moustache and imperial gave me a white Spitz puppy which looked as if its coat had been woven out of the donor's luxuriant locks. The old gentleman, in whose veins ran the purest blood of Dutch Colonial New York, was called Mr. Lydig Suydam, and I should like his name to survive till this page has crumbled, for with his gift a new life began for me. The owning of my first dog made me into a conscious sentient person, fiercely possessive, anxiously watchful, and woke in me that long ache of pity for animals, and for all inarticulate beings, which nothing has ever stilled. How I loved that first "Foxy" of mine, how I cherished and yearned over and understood him! And how quickly he relegated all dolls and other inanimate toys to the region of my everlasting indifference!<br><br>I never cared much in my little-childhood for fairy tales, or any appeals to my fancy through the fabulous or legendary. My imagination lay there, coiled and sleeping, a mute hibernating creature, and at the least touch of common things -- flowers, animals, words, especially the sound of words, apart from their meaning -- it already stirred in its sleep, and then sank back into its own rich dream, which needed so little feeding from the outside that it instinctively rejected whatever another imagination had already adorned and completed. There was, however, one fairy tale at which I always thrilled -- the story of the boy who could talk with the birds and hear what the grasses said. Very early, earlier than my conscious memory can reach, I must have felt myself to be of kin to that happy child. I cannot remember when the grasses first spoke to me, though I think it was when, a few years later, one of my uncles took me, with some little cousins, to spend a long spring day in some marshy woods near Mamaroneck, where the earth was starred with pink trailing arbutus, where pouch-like white and rosy flowers grew in a swamp, and leafless branches against the sky were netted with buds of mother-of-pearl; but on the day when Foxy was given to me I learned what the animals say to each other, and to us....<br><br>2<br><br>The readers (and I should doubtless have been among them) who twenty years ago would have smiled at the idea that time could transform a group of <i>bourgeois</i> colonials and their republican descendants into a sort of social aristocracy, are now better able to measure the formative value of nearly three hundred years of social observance: the concerted living up to long-established standards of honour and conduct, of education and manners. The value of duration is slowly asserting itself against the welter of change, and sociologists without a drop of American blood in them have been the first to recognize what the traditions of three centuries have contributed to the moral wealth of our country. Even negatively, these traditions have acquired, with the passing of time, an unsuspected value. When I was young it used to seem to me that the group in which I grew up was like an empty vessel into which no new wine would ever again be poured. Now I see that one of its uses lay in preserving a few drops of an old vintage too rare to be savoured by a youthful palate; and I should like to atone for my unappreciativeness by trying to revive that faint fragrance.<br><br>If any one had suggested to me, before 1914, to write my reminiscences, I should have answered that my life had been too uneventful to be worth recording. Indeed, I had never even thought of recording it for my own amusement, and the fact that until 1918 I never kept even the briefest of diaries has greatly hampered this tardy reconstruction. Not until the successive upheavals which culminated in the catastrophe of 1914 had "cut all likeness from the name" of my old New York, did I begin to see its pathetic picturesqueness. The first change came in the 'eighties, with the earliest detachment of big money:makers from the West, soon to be followed by the lords of Pittsburgh. But their infiltration did not greatly affect old manners and customs, since the dearest ambition of the newcomers was to assimilate existing traditions. Social life, with us as in the rest of the world, went on with hardly perceptible changes till the war abruptly tore down the old hame-work, and what had seemed unalterable rules of conduct became of a sudden observances as quaintly arbitrary as the domestic rites of the Pharaohs. Between the point of view of my Huguenot great-great-grandfather, who came from the French Palatinate to participate in the founding of New Rochelle, and my own father, who died in 1882, there were fewer differences than between my father and the post-war generation of Americans. That I was born into a world in which telephones, motors, electric light, central heating (except by hot-air furnaces), X-rays, cinemas, radium, aeroplanes and wireless telegraphy were not only unknown but still mostly unforeseen, may seem the most striking difference between then and now; but the really vital change is that, in my youth, the Americans of the original States, who in moments of crisis still shaped the national point of view, were the heirs of an old tradition of European culture which the country has now totally rejected. This rejection (which Mr. Walter Lippmann regards as the chief cause of the country's present moral impoverishment) has opened a gulf between those days and these. The compact world of my youth has receded into a past from which it can only be dug up in bits by the assiduous relic-hunter; and its smallest fragments begin to be worth collecting and putting together before the last of those who knew the live structure are swept away with it.<br><br>3<br><br>My little-girl life, safe, guarded, monotonous, was cradled in the only world about which, according to Goethe, it is impossible to write poetry. The small society into which I was born was "good" in the most prosaic sense of the term, and its only interest, for the generality of readers, lies in the fact of its sudden and total extinction, and for the imaginative few in the recognition of the moral treasures that went with it. Let me try to call it back....<br><br>Once, when I was about fifteen, my parents took me to Annapolis for the graduating ceremonies of the Naval Academy. In my infancy I had travelled extensively on the farther side of the globe, and it was thought high time that I should begin to see something of my own half.<br><br>I recall with delight the charming old Academic buildings grouped about turf and trees, and the smartness of the cadets (among whom were some of my young friends) in their dress uniforms; and thrilling memories of speeches, marchings, military music and strawberry ice, flutter pleasingly about the scene. On the way back we stopped in Baltimore and Washington; but neither city offered much to youthful eyes formed by the spectacle of Rome and Paris. Washington, in the days before Charles McKim had seen its possibilities, and resolved to develop them on Major L'Enfant's lines, was in truth a doleful desert; and it was a weary and bored little girl who trailed after her parents through the echoing emptiness of the Capitol, and at last into the famous Rotunda with its paintings of Revolutionary victories. Trumbull was little thought of as a painter in those days (Munkacsky would doubtless have been preferred to him), and when one great panel after another was pointed out to me, and I was led up first to the "Surrender of Burgoyne" and then to the "Surrender of Cornwallis", and told: "There's your great-grandfather," the tall thin young man in the sober uniform of a general of artillery, leaning against a cannon in the foreground of one picture, in the other galloping across the battlefield, impressed me much less than the beautiful youths to whom I had just said goodbye at Annapolis. If anything, I was vaguely sorry to have any one belonging to me represented in those stiff old-fashioned pictures, so visibly inferior to the battle-scenes of Horace Vernet and Detaille. I remember feeling no curiosity about my great-grandfather, and my parents said nothing to rouse my interest in him. The New Yorker of that day was singularly, inexplicably indifferent to his descent, and my father and mother were no exception to the rule.<br><br>It was many years later that I began to suspect that Trumbull was very nearly a great painter, and my great-grandfather Stevens very nearly a great man; but by that time all who had known him, and could have spoken of him familiarly, had long been dead, and he was no more than a museum-piece to me. It is a pity, for he must have been worth knowing, even at second hand.<br><br>On both sides our colonial ancestry goes back for nearly three hundred years, and on both sides the colonists in question seem to have been identified since early days with New York, though my earliest Stevens forbears went first to Massachusetts. Some of the first Stevens's grandsons, however, probably not being of the stripe of religious fanatic or political reformer to breathe easily in that passionate province, transferred their activities to the easier-going New York, where people seem from the outset to have been more interested in making money and acquiring property than in Predestination and witch-burning. I have always wondered if those old New Yorkers did not owe their greater suavity and tolerance to the fact that the Church of England (so little changed under its later name of Episcopal Church of America) provided from the first their prevalent form of worship. May not the matchless beauty of an ancient rite have protected our ancestors from what Huxley called the "fissiparous tendency of the Protestant sects", sparing them sanguinary wrangles over uncomprehended points of doctrine, and all those extravagances of self-constituted prophets and evangelists which rent and harrowed New England? Milder manners, a greater love of ease, and a franker interest in money-making and good food, certainly distinguished the colonial New Yorkers from the conscience-searching children of the "Mayflower". Apart from some of the old Dutch colonial families, who continued to follow the "Dutch Reformed" rite, the New York of my youth was distinctively Episcopalian; and to this happy chance I owe my early saturation with the noble cadences of the Book of Common Prayer, and my reverence for an ordered ritual in which the officiant's personality is strictly subordinated to the rite he performs.<br><br>Colonial New York was mostly composed of merchants and bankers; my own ancestors were mainly merchant ship-owners, and my great-grandmother Stevens's wedding-dress, a gauzy Directoire web of embroidered "India mull", was made for her in India and brought to New York on one of her father's merchantmen. My mother, who had a hearty contempt for the tardy discovery of aristocratic genealogies, always said that old New York was composed of Dutch and British middle-class families, and that only four or five could show a pedigree leading back to the aristocracy of their ancestral country. These, if I remember rightly, were the Duets, the Livingstons, the Rutherfurds, the de Grasses and the Van Rensselaers (descendants, these latter, of the original Dutch "Patroon"). I name here only families settled in colonial New York; others, from the southern states, but well known in New York -- such as the Fairfaxes, Carys, Calverts and Whartons -- should be added if the list included the other colonies.<br></p><h2>World Hallmarks - Vol. I - Europe, 19th to 21st Centuries, 2nd Edition</h2><p>The most comprehensive book written on European gold, silver, platinum and palladium hallmarks to-date.

He also conducted the most legendary celebrity interview in history, opening with, &#x201c;Dr. Livingstone, I presume?&#x201d; But these perceptions are not quite true, Tim Jeal shows in this grand and colorful biography. With unprecedented access to previously closed Stanley family archives, Jeal reveals the amazing extent to which Stanley&#x2019;s public career and intimate life have been misunderstood and undervalued. Jeal recovers the reality of Stanley&#x2019;s life&#x2014;a life of almost impossible extremes&#x2014;in this moving story of tragedy, adventure, disappointment, and success.</p><p>Few have started life as disadvantaged as Stanley. Rejected by both parents and consigned to a Welsh workhouse, he emigrated to America as a penniless eighteen-year-old. Jeal vividly re-creates Stanley&#x2019;s rise to success, his friendships and romantic relationships, and his&nbsp; life-changing decision to assume an American identity. Stanley&#x2019;s epic but&nbsp; unfairly forgotten African journeys are thrillingly described, establishing&nbsp; the explorer as the greatest to set foot on the continent. Few biographies can claim so thoroughly to reappraise a reputation; few portray a more extraordinary historical figure.</p></p><p><b>Tim Jeal </b>is also the biographer of Henry Morton Stanley (National Book Critics' Circle Award in Biography and Sunday Times Biography of the Year 2007), and Robert Baden-Powell, which (like Livingstone) was chosen as a Notable Book of the Year by the New York Times and the Washington Post. In 2011 his Explorers of the Nile was a New York Times Editor's Choice and a BBC Radio 4 Book of the Week.<br><p>Reviewed by Jason Roberts</p><p>It's hard to imagine a more intriguing -- and intimidating -- challenge to the biographer's art than the life of journalist, explorer and continental opportunist Sir Henry Morton Stanley (1841-1904). He is rare among celebrities of centuries past, in that the years have not transmuted his fame into benign augustness nor obscurity, but rather into infamy: Post-Victorian sensibilities have long since extinguished the heroic light once cast upon Stanley's expeditions into so-called "darkest Africa." The man who did more than any other Westerner to illuminate what Joseph Conrad termed "the unsolved mystery of that continent" is now less commemorated for his achievements than condemned for the ruthlessness by which he achieved them.</p><p>Even during his lifetime, exploits that once thrilled admirers began to appall. Stanley wrote casually of beating his native porters to perk up "the physical energy of the lazily inclined." He once observed that the massacre of 33 Bumbireh warriors should teach the survivors to "in future behave with some regard to the rights of strangers." Yet as Tim Jeal points out in this commanding, definitive biography, much of this was bluster, calculated to fit the public-consumption ideal of the Great White Conqueror.</p><p>The unguarded Stanley was remarkably minimal in his racism, declaring himself "prepared to admit any black man possessing the attributes of true manhood, or any good qualities, to my friendship, even to a brotherhood with myself." The violence he perpetrated was regularly exaggerated, usually by Stanley himself. It's not hard to find evidence of similarly inexcusable behavior among his contemporary explorers -- even the Scottish missionary David Livingstone, whom Stanley famously set out to "rescue" from the African interior, not only killed several natives but punitively burned their huts. None of this serves as an apology for the man, but it demonstrates that is impossible to view Henry Morton Stanley plain. One must filter his image through two distorting prisms, that of his era and of our own.</p><p>The overarching challenge of Stanley's biographers has always been one of sorting through the subject's self-perpetuated bits of legendry, glosses on the truth and outright lies, and here Jeal takes an already-fascinating story to new levels. It's long been known that "Henry Morton Stanley" began life as John Rowlands, the illegitimate and abandoned child of a teenage mother in Wales; after years of suppressing that fact, Stanley explained that, wanting to escape both "the stains [of] ugly poverty" and "the odium attached to the old name and its dolorous history," he'd made his way to New Orleans, where he'd been propitiously adopted by the cotton broker Henry Hope Stanley. But Jeal puts forth, for the first time, convincing evidence that this was an utter fabrication. It's likely that Stanley never even met the wealthy merchant whose name he appropriated.</p><p>Profoundly rootless in Civil War-era America, the young man drifted through both the Confederate and Union armies, then through the U.S. Navy (which he deserted for the goldfields of Colorado) before seeking glory overseas. He launched an ill-starred expedition to Asia Minor -- in reality, a jaunt on a fruit boat from Boston to Smyrna, which promptly degraded into chaos, claims of horse thievery and a stint in a Turkish prison. But the persona of Stanley the adventurer was born. He was 26 in 1867, when he convinced the New York Herald to underwrite the publicity stunt of tracking Livingstone (who was not lost, just rarely able to communicate with the outside world) to the shores of Lake Tanganyika.</p><p>Stunt though it was, the trek and two subsequent expeditions proved supreme tests of will. Stanley emerged from Africa 18 years later "like a man of seventy-five: gaunt, hollow-eyed and grim," haunted by the deaths of the vast majority of his traveling companions, famous but constantly in fear of being exposed as the self-creation he was -- or worse yet, as the cast-off, low-caste boy he had been.</p><p>Jeal's biography is an unalloyed triumph, not only because it is painstakingly researched and eminently readable, but because it never loses sight of the abandoned child in the man, driving him forward, "able to frighten, able to suffer, but also able to command love and obedience." Such a personality, Jeal notes, is "an extinct species, and all the more remarkable for that." </p><p> </p><p><br>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

Building on the authors&#x2019; decades of collective experience in law enforcement, training, and teaching, <i> <b> <i>Police Administration 8e</i> </b> </i>is recognized by both the academic and law enforcement communities as the authoritative treatment of this topic. Fully updated in this edition, it includes the latest on the evolution of American policing, the organization and the leader, the management of police organizations, and modern organizational issues.</p></p><p>Thoroughly researched, this edition comprehensively covers the field of police administration and provides a carefully balanced treatment of its procedural, structural, and behavioral aspects.PREFACE <p> The field of police administration is dynamic and ever changing. Laws are modified, new problems occur, and administrative practices that were once accepted as gospel are challenged, modified, and in some cases, discarded. In this edition, as with the previous four editions, we have tried to provide the most current and useful information to the reader in an effort to help them deal with these dynamic forces and the ever-changing environment of police work. </p> <p> Collectively the three authors have been police officers, detectives, administrators, and educators for over eighty years. We have studied, practiced, researched, taught, and consulted on police administration and an inevitable by-product of these experiences is the development of certain perspectives. It is these perspectives that form the rationale for this book. </p> <p> There is much new information in this book the reader will find informative and useful. For example, Chapter Two, Community Policing is a new chapter which focuses on the impact of community policing on police administration. We also discuss the expanded coverage of the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (CAPS). In Chapter 3, Politics and Police Administration there is an expanded discussion on the issues of police brutality and scandal as well as discussions of militias, right-wing groups in the United States and school violence. In Chapter 8, Human Resource Management we discuss the arguments presented in favor of requiring a college education for police applicants as well as arguments presented by some groups opposing college education for police applicants. Also in this chapter we have added new material on the Administration of Discipline, Internal Affairs Units, and Retirement Counseling. In Chapter 9, Stress and Police Personnel we have expanded our discussion on police suicide and address in considerable detail the phenomenon known as Suicide by Cop (SbC), Stress and the Female Police Officer and Police Domestic Violence. In Chapter 11, Legal Aspects of Police Administration there is a feature on the now infamous New York City Abner Louima case and its impact along with a discussion of several other high profile cases that have occurred in recent years in New York City. There is also a discussion of a recent Supreme Court decision which limits liability for injuries and deaths associated with high speed police pursuit as well as an update and expanded discussion of sexual harassment in the workplace. In Chapter 12, Planning and Decision Making, we have provided updated material on the investigation of the Branch Davidian Seige in Waco, Texas, focusing on the potential coverup and misuse of military personnel during the engagement. </p> <p> As with all previous editions, we have attempted to provide newspaper clippings, case studies and vignettes from our own experience. These are scattered throughout to illustrate points discussed in the narrative in order to make them more informative and interesting. </p> <p> Finally, the mention of any product or firm in this book is intended for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily constitute an endorsement or recommendation by the authors or the publisher.</p></p><h2>Exploring Art: A Global, Thematic Approach</h2><p>EXPLORING ART uses art examples from around the world to discuss art in the context of religion, politics, family structure, sexuality, entertainment and visual culture.</p><p>Margaret Lazzari is an art critic and writer whose books include Art and Design Fundamentals and The Practical Handbook for the Emerging Artist.

Her drawings and multimedia have been exhibited nationally and internationally."I was thrilled to read the text! I believe art is best appreciated by students if it is thematic because that is how the students have been exposed to art so far in their lives. I love the thematic approach. I think non-western arts and cultures are well represented throughout the textbook. Women and gender issue are addressed directly and clearly, in culturally appropriate manner." -- Aditi Samarth, Richland College<br><br>"The most difficult aspect of Art Apprec is placement of concepts into history. What I love about this book is the format of grouping art into subjects: 'food, shelter, etc.,' which immediately makes the topics more digestible and less intimidating." -- Lynn Peters, Moraine Valley Community College</p><h2>Make Peace with Your Mind: How Mindfulness and Compassion Can Free You from Your Inner Critic</h2><p>The inner critic is the voice inside our heads reminding us that we are never good enough.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s behind the insidious thoughts that can make us second-guess our every action and doubt our own value. The inner critic might feel overpowering, but it can be managed effectively. Meditation teacher and therapist Mark Coleman helps readers understand and free themselves from the inner critic using the tools of mindfulness and compassion.

Engagingly written, exhaustively researched, and rich in detail, this book describes how Prohibition devastated the wine industry, the conditions of renewal after Repeal, the various New Deal measures that affected wine, and the early markets and methods. Thomas Pinney goes on to examine the effects of World War II and how the troubled postwar years led to the great wine boom of the late 1960s, the spread of winegrowing to almost every state, and its continued expansion to the present day.<br><br>The history of wine in America is, in many ways, the history of America and of American enterprise in microcosm. Pinney's sweeping narrative comprises a lively cast of characters that includes politicians, bootleggers, entrepreneurs, growers, scientists, and visionaries. Pinney relates the development of winemaking in states such as New York and Ohio; its extension to Pennsylvania, Virginia, Texas, and other states; and its notable successes in California, Washington, and Oregon. He is the first to tell the complete and connected story of the rebirth of the wine industry in California, now one of the most successful winemaking regions in the world.</p><p>"Pinney covers new ground and new research, and treats the entire period in a new way.

In this book, Geoffrey Batchen analyzes the desire to photograph as it emerged within the philosophical and scientific milieus that preceded the actual invention of photography. Recent accounts of photography's identity tend to divide between the postmodern view that all identity is determined by context and a formalist effort to define the fundamental characteristics of photography as a medium. Batchen critiques both approaches by way of a detailed discussion of photography's conception in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He examines the output of the various nominees for "first photographer," then incorporates this information into a mode of historical criticism informed by the work of Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. The result is a way of thinking about photography that persuasively accords with the medium's undeniable conceptual, political, and historical complexity.</p></p><p>If, by 1725, all the chemical and optical necessities for the practice of photography already existed, why wasn't the art form invented until 1839? Geoffrey Batchen, an associate professor of art history and author of <i>Burning with Desire</i>, has an interesting answer: people simply weren't ready for it. Along with a blossoming in literature, philosophy, music, and science, the 18th century was also host to a whole new way of thinking about nature and landscape. The camera obscura, a portable box equipped with a lens or a mirror, was a popular tool that people used to first capture views and then trace them. The ability to reproduce a scene--however imperfectly--whet people's appetites for more exact methods, leading first to what Batchen calls the "proto-photographers," and then sometime later to the invention of Louis Daguerre's daguerrotype and Henry Fox Talbot's photography in the same year. <p> Batchen's history lesson is filled with eccentric characters and fascinating insights into passions and obsessions of the Age of Enlightenment. The book becomes controversial, however, in Batchen's assertion that the early photographers, rather than trying to capture reality, were, in fact, attempting to decontruct it--long before Jacques Derrida created the theory of deconstruction. Whether or not you end up agreeing with Batchen, <i>Burning with Desire</i> is a unique look at photography's roots, one sure to engender heated discussion among enthusiasts of the art form.</p>Geoffrey Batchen is Professor of the History of Photography and Contemporary Art at the City University of New York Graduate Center.

Since then, Fisher has conducted pioneering brain research on lust, romantic love, and attachment; gathered data on more than 80,000 people to explain why you love who you love; and collected information on more than 30,000 men and women on sexting, hooking up, friends with benefits, and other current trends in courtship and marriage. And she presents a new, scientifically based and optimistic perspective on relationships in our digital age&#x2015;what she calls &#x201c;slow love.&#x201d;</p><p>This is a cutting-edge tour de force that traces human family life from its origins in Africa over 20 million years ago to the Internet dating sites and bedrooms of today. And it&#x2019;s got it all: the copulatory gaze and other natural courting ploys; the who, when, where, and why of adultery; love addictions; her discovery of four broad chemically based personality styles and what each seeks in romance; the newest data on worldwide (biologically based) patterns of divorce; how and why men and women think differently; the real story of women, men, and power; the rise&#x2015;and fall&#x2015;of the sexual double standard; and what brain science tells us about how to make and keep a happy partnership.</p></p><p>Helen Fisher , a biological anthropologist, is the author of five internationally selling books, including Why We Love and Why Him? Why Her? A Senior Research Fellow at the Kinsey Institute, a member of the Center for Human Evolutionary Studies at Rutgers University, and the chief scientific advisor to Match.com, Fisher is a frequent national and international speaker. Her TED talks have been viewed by more than 10 million people; and she lives in New York City.&#x201c;Is romantic love a creation of troubadours and poets, or has it deep evolutionary roots? Is the seven-year itch really the four-year itch? Does true love betray itself in a brain scanner? With the eyes of an anthropologist and the voice of a poet, Helen Fisher lays bare the many worlds and ages of erotic love. And she knows whereof she speaks.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Dawkins</strong><br><br>&#x201c;For journalists around the world, Helen Fisher has been the go-to authority on love and heartache since the first edition of Anatomy of Love. No one else knows the human heart so well&#x2015;or explains it with such wit and style.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Tierney, coauthor of <em>Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This book is a marvel. I eagerly read everything Helen Fisher writes. She is a national treasure. So illuminating!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Gottman, author of the revised <em>Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Our conversations with Helen Fisher were crucial to understanding the current romantic climate. This revised version of <em>Anatomy of Love</em> is a great read for anyone interested in understanding love and romance. Also, Helen was kind enough to blurb our book, so we&#x2019;d be real dicks not to do the same for her. Luckily, her work is fantastic and no moral dilemma has been posed.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Aziz Ansari and Eric Klinenberg, authors of <em>Modern Romance</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fisher weaves a persuasive and consistently surprising new explanation of the roots of human marriage, sex, and love.

The recent success of comedian Aziz Ansari and sociologist Eric Klinenberg&#x2019;s <em>Modern Romance</em> (2015) suggests readers might be looking for further, more serious reading on the topic: Fisher&#x2019;s book and its hundreds upon hundreds of cited sources won&#x2019;t disappoint them.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong></p><h2>Biopsychology (9th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Delves into how the central nervous system governs behavior</i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Biopsychology, 9/e,</i> introduces the study of the biology of behavior; that is, the neural mechanisms of psychological processes in the central nervous system.

After postgraduate work in plastic surgery in Europe, Maltz was appointed to head several departments of reparative surgery in New York hospitals over his long and distinguished career. He was a prominent international lecturer on the psychological aspects of plastic surgery. He published two books on the subject,<i> New Faces, New Futures</i> and <i>Dr. Pygmalion</i>. In the 1950s, Maltz became increasingly fascinated by the number of patients who came to him requesting surgery who had greatly exaggerated "mental pictures" of their physical deformities, and whose unhappiness and insecurities remained unchanged even after he gave them the new faces they desired. In 1960, after nearly a decade of counseling hundreds of such patients, extensive research, and testing his evolving theory of "success conditioning" on athletes, salespeople, and others, he published his findings -- then radical ideas -- in the first edition of <i>Psycho-Cybernetics</i>, which went on to sell millions of copies and to be translated in dozens of languages.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Self-Image: Your Key to a Better Life</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the past decade a revolution has been quietlygoing on in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and medicine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>New theories and concepts concerning the &#x201c;self&#x201d; havegrown out of the work and findings of clinical psychologists, practicingpsychiatrists and cosmetic or so-called &#x201c;plastic surgeons.&#x201d; New methods growingout of these findings have resulted in rather dramatic changes in personality,health, and apparently even in basic abilities and talents. Chronic failureshave become successful. &#x201c;F&#x201d; students have changed into &#x201c;straight A&#x201d; pupilswithin a matter of days and with no extra tutoring. Shy, retiring, inhibitedpersonalities have become happy and outgoing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Writing in the January, 1959 issue of Cosmopolitanmagazine, T. F. James summarizes the results obtained by various psychologistsand M.D.&#x2019;s as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Understanding the psychology of the self can mean thedifference between success and failure, love and hate, bitterness andhappiness. The discovery of the real self can rescue a crumbling marriage,recreate a faltering career, transform victims of &#x2018;personality failure.&#x2019; Onanother plane, discovering your real self means the difference between freedomand the compulsions of conformity.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your Key to a Better Life</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most important psychologic discovery of this centuryis the discovery of the &#x201c;self-image.&#x201d; Whether we realize it or not, each of uscarries about with us a mental blueprint or picture of ourselves. It may bevague and ill-defined to our conscious gaze. In fact, it may not be consciouslyrecognizable at all. But it is there, complete down to the last detail. Thisself-image is our own conception of the &#x201c;sort of person I am.&#x201d; It has beenbuilt up from our own beliefs about ourselves. But most of these beliefs aboutourselves have unconsciously been formed from our past experiences, oursuccesses and failures, our humiliations, our triumphs, and the way otherpeople have reacted to us, especially in early childhood. From all these wementally construct a &#x201c;self&#x201d; (or a picture of a self). Once an idea or beliefabout ourselves goes into this picture it becomes &#x201c;true,&#x201d; as far as wepersonally are concerned. We do not question its validity, but proceed to actupon it just as if it were true.</p><p>This self-image becomes a golden key to living a betterlife because of two important discoveries:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(1) All your actions, feelings, behavior&#x2014;even yourabilities&#x2014;are always consistent with this self-image.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In short, you will &#x201c;act like&#x201d; the sort of person youconceive yourself to be. Not only this, but you literally cannot act otherwise,in spite of all your conscious efforts or will power. The man who conceiveshimself to be a &#x201c;failure?type person&#x201d; will find some way to fail, in spite ofall his good intentions, or his will power, even if opportunity is literallydumped in his lap. The person who conceives himself to be a victim ofinjustice, one &#x201c;who was meant to suffer,&#x201d; will invariably find circumstances toverify his opinions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The self-image is a &#x201c;premise,&#x201d; a base, or a foundationupon which your entire personality, your behavior, and even your circumstancesare built. Because of this our experiences seem to verify, and therebystrengthen our self images, and a vicious or a beneficent cycle, as the casemay be, is set up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a schoolboy who sees himself as an &#x201c;F&#x201d; typestudent, or one who is &#x201c;dumb in mathematics,&#x201d; will invariably find that hisreport card bears him out. He then has &#x201c;proof.&#x201d; A young girl who has an imageof herself as the sort of person nobody likes will find indeed that she isavoided at the school dance. She literally invites rejection. Her woe-begoneexpression, her hang-dog manner, her over-??anxiousness to please, or perhapsher unconscious hostility towards those she anticipates will affront her&#x2014;allact to drive away those whom she would attract. In the same manner, a salesmanor a businessman will also find that his actual experiences tend to &#x201c;prove&#x201d; hisself-image is correct.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this objective &#x201c;proof&#x201d; it very seldom occursto a person that his trouble lies in his self-image or his own evaluation ofhimself. Tell the schoolboy that he only &#x201c;thinks&#x201d; he cannot master algebra, andhe will doubt your sanity. He has tried and tried, and still his report card tellsthe story. Tell the salesman that it is only an idea that he cannot earn morethan a certain figure, and he can prove you wrong by his order book. He knowsonly too well how hard he has tried and failed. Yet, as we shall see later,almost miraculous changes have occurred both in grades of students, and in theearning capacity of salesmen&#x2014;when they were prevailed upon to change theirself-images.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(2) The self-image can be changed. Numerous casehistories have shown that one is never too young nor too old to change hisself-image and thereby start to live a new life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the reasons it has seemed so difficult for aperson to change his habits, his personality, or his way of life, has been thatheretofore nearly all efforts at change have been directed to the circumferenceof the self, so to speak, rather than to the center. Numerous patients havesaid to me something like the following: &#x201c;If you are talking about &#x2018;positivethinking,&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve tried that before, and it just doesn&#x2019;t work for me.&#x201d; However, alittle questioning invariably brings out that these individuals have employed&#x201c;positive thinking,&#x201d; or attempted to employ it, either upon particular externalcircumstances, or upon some particular habit or character defect (&#x201c;I will getthat job.&#x201d; &#x201c;I will be more calm and relaxed in the future.&#x201d; &#x201c;This businessventure will turn out right for me,&#x201d; etc.) But they had never thought to changetheir thinking of the &#x201c;self&#x201d; which was to accomplish these things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus warned us about the folly of putting a patch of newmaterial upon an old garment, or of putting new wine into old bottles.&#x201c;Positive thinking&#x201d; cannot be used effectively as a patch or a crutch to thesame self-image. In fact, it is literally impossible to really think about aparticular situation, as long as you hold a negative concept of self. And,numerous experiments have shown that once the concept of self is changed, otherthings consistent with the new concept of self, are accomplished easily andwithout strain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the earliest and most convincing experiments alongthis line was conducted by the late Prescott Lecky, one of the pioneers inself-image psychology. Lecky conceived of the personality as a &#x201c;system ofideas,&#x201d; all of which must seem to be consistent with each other. Ideas whichare inconsistent with the system are rejected, &#x201c;not believed,&#x201d; and not actedupon. Ideas which seem to be consistent with the system are accepted. At thevery center of this system of ideas&#x2014;the keystone&#x2014;the base upon which all elseis built, is the individual&#x2019;s &#x201c;ego ideal,&#x201d; his &#x201c;self-image,&#x201d; or his conceptionof himself. Lecky was a school teacher and had an opportunity to test histheory upon thousands of students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lecky theorized that if a student had trouble learning acertain subject, it could be because (from the student&#x2019;s point of view) itwould be inconsistent for him to learn it. Lecky believed, however, that if youcould change the student&#x2019;s self-conception, which underlies this viewpoint, hisattitude toward the subject would change accordingly. If the student could beinduced to change his self-definition, his learning ability should also change.This proved to be the case. One student who misspelled 55 words out of ahundred and flunked so many subjects that he lost credit for a year, made ageneral average of 91 the next year and became one of the best spellers inschool. A boy who was dropped from one college because of poor grades, enteredColumbia and became a straight &#x201c;A&#x201d; student. A girl who had flunked Latin fourtimes, after three talks with the school counselor, finished with a grade of84. A boy who was told by a testing bureau that he had no aptitude for English,won honorable mention the next year for a literary prize.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The trouble with these students was not that they weredumb, or lacking in basic aptitudes. The trouble was an inadequate self-image(&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a mathematical mind&#x201d;; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just naturally a poor speller&#x201d;). They&#x201c;identified&#x201d; with their mistakes and failures. Instead of saying &#x201c;I failed thattest&#x201d; (factual and descriptive) they concluded &#x201c;I am a failure.&#x201d; Instead ofsaying &#x201c;I flunked that subject&#x201d; they said &#x201c;I am a flunk-out.&#x201d; For those who areinterested in learning more of Lecky&#x2019;s work, I recommend securing a copy of hisbook: Self Consistency, a Theory of Personality, The Island Press, New York.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lecky also used the same method to cure students of suchhabits as nail biting and stuttering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My own files contain case histories just as convincing:the man who was so afraid of strangers that he seldom ventured out of thehouse, and who now makes his living as a public speaker. The salesman who hadalready prepared a letter of resignation because he &#x201c;just wasn&#x2019;t cut out forselling,&#x201d; and six months later was number one man on a force of 100 salesmen.The minister who was considering retirement because &#x201c;nerves&#x201d; and the pressureof preparing a sermon a week were getting him down, and now delivers an averageof three &#x201c;outside talks&#x201d; a week in addition to his weekly sermons and doesn&#x2019;tknow he has a nerve in his body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How a Plastic Surgeon Became Interested in Self-ImagePsychology</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Offhand, there would seem to be little or no connectionbetween surgery and psychology. Yet, it was the work of the plastic surgeonwhich first hinted at the existence of the &#x201c;self-image&#x201d; and raised certain questionswhich led to important psychologic knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I first began the practice of plastic surgery manyyears ago, I was amazed by the dramatic and sudden changes in character andpersonality which often resulted when a facial defect was corrected. Changingthe physical image in many instances appeared to create an entirely new person.In case after case the scalpel that I held in my hand became a magic wand thatnot only transformed the patient&#x2019;s appearance, but transformed his whole life.The shy and retiring became bold and courageous. A &#x201c;moronic,&#x201d; &#x201c;stupid&#x201d; boychanged into an alert, bright youngster who went on to become an executive witha prominent firm. A salesman who had lost his touch and his faith in himselfbecame a model of self confidence. And perhaps the most startling of all wasthe habitual &#x201c;hardened&#x201d; criminal who changed almost overnight from anincorrigible who had never showed any desire to change, into a model prisonerwho won a parole and went on to assume a responsible role in society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some twenty years ago I reported many such case historiesin my book New Faces&#x2014;New Futures. Following its publication, and similararticles in leading magazines, I was besieged with questions by criminologists,sociologists and psychiatrists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They asked questions that I could not answer. But theydid start me upon a search. Strangely enough, I learned as much if not morefrom my failures as from my successes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was easy to explain the successes. The boy with thetoo-big ears, who had been told that he looked like a taxi-cab with both doorsopen. He had been ridiculed all his life&#x2014;often cruelly. Association withplaymates meant humiliation and pain. Why shouldn&#x2019;t he avoid social contacts?Why shouldn&#x2019;t he become afraid of people and retire into himself? Terriblyafraid to express himself in any way it was no wonder he became known as amoron. When his ears were corrected, it would seem only natural that the causeof his embarrassment and humiliation had been removed and that he should assumea normal role in life&#x2014;which he did.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Or consider the salesman who suffered a facialdisfigurement as the result of an automobile accident. Each morning when heshaved he could see the horrible disfiguring scar on his cheek and thegrotesque twist to his mouth. For the first time in his life he becamepainfully self-conscious. He was ashamed of himself and felt that hisappearance must be repulsive to others. The scar became an obsession with him.He was &#x201c;different&#x201d; from other people. He began to &#x201c;wonder&#x201d; what others werethinking of him. Soon his ego was even more mutilated than his face. He beganto lose confidence in himself. He became bitter and hostile. Soon almost allhis attention was directed toward himself&#x2014;and his primary goal became theprotection of his ego and the avoidance of situations which might bringhumiliation. It is easy to understand how the correction of his facialdisfigurement and the restoration of a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; face would overnight changethis man&#x2019;s entire attitude and outlook, his feelings about himself, and resultin greater success in his work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what about the exceptions who didn&#x2019;t change? TheDuchess who all her life had been terribly shy and self-conscious because of atremendous hump in her nose? Although surgery gave her a classic nose and aface that was truly beautiful, she still continued to act the part of the uglyduckling, the unwanted sister who could never bring herself to look anotherhuman being in the eye. If the scalpel itself was magic, why did it not work onthe Duchess?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Or what about all the others who acquired new faces butwent right on wearing the same old personality? Or how explain the reaction ofthose people who insist that the surgery has made no difference whatsoever intheir appearance? Every plastic surgeon has had this experience and hasprobably been as baffled by it as I was. No matter how drastic the change inappearance may be, there are certain patients who will insist that &#x201c;I look justthe same as before&#x2014;you didn&#x2019;t do a thing.&#x201d; Friends, even family, may scarcelyrecognize them, may become enthusiastic over their newly acquired &#x201c;beauty,&#x201d; yetthe patient herself insists that she can see only slight or no improvement, orin fact deny that any change at all has been made. Comparison of &#x201c;before&#x201d; and&#x201c;after&#x201d; photographs does little good, except possibly to arouse hostility. Bysome strange mental alchemy the patient will rationalize, &#x201c;Of course, I can seethat the hump is no longer in my nose&#x2014;but my nose still looks just the same,&#x201d;or, &#x201c;The scar may not show any more, but it&#x2019;s still there.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Scars That Bring Pride Instead of Shame</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still another clue in search of the elusive self-imagewas the fact that not all scars or disfigurements bring shame and humiliation.When I was a young medical student in Germany, I saw many another studentproudly wearing his &#x201c;saber scar&#x201d; much as an American might wear the Medal ofHonor. The duelists were the elite of college society and a facial scar was thebadge that proved you a member in good standing. To these boys, the acquisitionof a horrible scar on the cheek had the same psychologic effect as theeradication of the scar from the cheek of my salesman patient. In old NewOrleans a Creole wore an eye patch in much the same way. I began to see that aknife itself held no magical powers. It could be used on one person to inflicta scar and on another to erase a scar, with the same psychological results.</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Consumer Mathematics student workbook</h2><p><p><strong>Teach your students to become well-informed consumers</strong></p> <p><em>Consumer Mathematics</em> presents basic math skills used in everyday situations&#x2014;paying taxes, buying food, banking and investing, and managing a household.

It presents equal treatment to information about the characteristics, definitions, causes, and controversies of learning disabilities, with each researched-based topic clearly designed to support both diagnosis and intervention. Throughout the text, &#x201c;best practices&#x201d; have been identified through thorough research and practical examples. Revised to include the latest research and recent developments, the seventh edition reflects the latest trends in the field of learning disabilities. Current and classic, <i>Students with Learning Disabilities</i>, Seventh Edition will stimulate and interest its readers about the nature and needs of individuals with learning disabilities in today&#x2019;s school environment.</p></p><p>This text addresses every aspect of learning disabilities, from assessment, definition, and characteristics through specific strategies for individual disorders. Based on a multi-theoretical foundation, this new edition integrates numerous philosophical and practical perspectives into a supportive framework of best practices for both diagnosis and intervention.<p> Learning disabilities is a dynamic and expanding field. Individuals with learning disabilities exist across all ages, socioeconomic levels, and ethnic groups; their problems range from mild to severe. Professionals as well as parents continue to seek greater knowledge about the nature of learning disabilities and proven methods for enhancing academic, social, and vocational success for people with learning disabilities. </p> <p> This book offers comprehensive coverage of the field. Many theories and practices have developed quickly. Some have been challenged and found to be lacking. Thus, many practices have been refined, whereas others have either waned or grown. In this text, we have tried to present a balanced picture of the varying theories and practices (educational, medical, and psychological), and we hope this allows you to develop your own perspective. </p> <p> The book has been revised to include recent developments. This sixth edition reflects the latest trends in the field of learning disabilities, explores current issues, and highlights identification, including response to treatment. The 1997 reauthorization of IDEA has been included. However, as this edition goes to press, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is undergoing reauthorization: We have addressed this issue throughout the text and will provide updates on the reauthorization on the Companion Website. The book is written from a perspective of what research indicates are the best practices in the field of learning disabilities in regards to identification, assessment, and intervention. Noteworthy changes in this edition include expanded coverage of cultural diversity, consensus documents in reading instruction, effective practices to prevent and remediate reading difficulties, and effective assessment and teaching practices in the academic areas based on recent meta-analyses of the best instructional practices. In addition, this edition has been streamlined to provide concise but complete information. Many of the additional resources found in previous editions, including reviews of specific curricula and materials, are provided on a new Companion Website. Each chapter has been refined extensively to provide comprehensive yet timely coverage of pertinent information. In addition to covering topics that facilitate an understanding of learning disabilities, we have included a strong focus on how to teach and manage students with learning disabilities. </p> <p> Why is the sixth edition of <i>Students with Learning Disabilities</i> a worthwhile book for your learning disabilities introductory class? It is as current as possible, and you will find the research to be well integrated. While an effort has been made to provide a definitive point of view, we also have tried to treat fairly the many approaches to learning disabilities. We have attempted to describe how schools really function in this country in an effort to assist you in handling situations in your current or future classrooms. </p> <p> In the field of learning disabilities, there are no easy answers. It is fraught with controversy, ambivalence, and vagueness, and it lacks consensus about many basic issues. We have made every effort to present the best of what we know. It is our hope that this book stimulates you to discover even more about the nature and needs of individuals with learning disabilities. </p></p><h2>Guide to Latex</h2><p><p>Published Nov 25, 2003 by Addison-Wesley Professional.

The Spaniard Juan Ponce de Le�n stumbled ashore near Melbourne Beach in 1513.

Over three centuries of Spanish and English colonial history followed before the United States acquired Florida in 1821. The first state flag was raised over a new capitol in Tallahassee on May 26, 1845.

The goal of this book is to introduce students to the &#x201c;multimethod approach&#x201d; to research in psychology, including observational, survey, and experimental methods. Students learn the strengths and weaknesses of each method, as well as ethical dilemmas when using them, so that they can become competent practitioners and thoughtful consumers of psychological research. Our approach is to engage students in the research process by describing contemporary research in psychology. Students learn about recent topics such as online dating and Facebook, cross-cultural observations of helping behavior, PTSD in orphaned chimpanzees, Medicaid and Medicare health outcomes, decision-making during Hurricane Katrina, clinical research and <i>DSM-5</i>, and much more. Each chapter's &#x201c;stretching exercises,&#x201d; &#x201c;stat tips,&#x201d; review questions, and challenge questions develop students' critical thinking about the psychological research that appears in scientific journals and in popular media.

The story is well-known, partly due to Mofolo but also to the works of literature by Badian, Senghor, and Mazisi Kunene. O.R. Dathorne has said, "The historical Chaka is only the impetus for Mofolo's psychological study of the nature of repudiation." Mofolo presents it as a study of human passion, of an uncontrolled and then uncontrollable ambition leading to the moral destruction of the character and the inevitable punishment.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>The Sacred Willow: Four Generations in the Life of a Vietnamese Family</h2><p>A finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, Duong Van Mai Elliott's <em>The Sacred Willow</em> illuminates recent Vietnamese history by weaving together the stories of the lives of four generations of her family. Beginning with her great-grandfather, who rose from rural poverty to become an influential landowner, and continuing to the present, Mai Elliott traces her family's journey through an era of tumultuous change. She tells us of childhood hours in her grandmother's silk shop, and of hiding while French troops torched her village, watching while blossoms torn by fire from the trees flutter "like hundreds of butterflies" overhead. She makes clear the agonizing choices that split Vietnamese families: her eldest sister left her staunchly anti-communist home to join the Viet Minh, and spent months sleeping in jungle camps with her infant son, fearing air raids by day and tigers by night. And she follows several family members through the last, desperate hours of the fall of Saigon-including one nephew who tried to escape by grabbing the skid of a departing American helicopter. Based on family papers, dozens of interviews, and a wealth of other research, this is not only a memorable family saga but a record of how the Vietnamese themselves have experienced their times.</p><p>Most books about Vietnam focus on the French who colonized it or the Americans who sought to "save" it. This combination of memoir and family history shows the Vietnamese "as they saw themselves as the central players in their own history." The author's perspective is particularly enlightening because her relatives, though unquestionably better-educated and better-off than the typical Vietnamese, made a variety of political and social choices over the course of the turbulent century she chronicles. Her great-grandfather was a mandarin and member of the imperial court; her father was a government official under French rule; her older sister married a Communist. Elliott herself enrolled in Georgetown's School of Foreign Service in 1960, married an American, and supported the U.S. crusade in Vietnam until her experiences interviewing Vietcong prisoners of war for a Rand Corporation study convinced her that the corrupt Saigon regime failed to offer a convincing alternative to Communism. Because she had family on both sides, Elliott's portrait of the war is subtler and less didactic than previous accounts by proponents of either ideology. Her prose is a bit formal and dense for the casual reader, but by telling her relatives' personal stories and explicating their culture's traditional values, her reflective narrative makes humanly complicated a history too often oversimplified. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><br><strong>Mai Elliott </strong>was born and raised in Vietnam and attended Georgetown University on a scholarship. She lived in Vietnam again from 1963 to 1968 and worked for the Rand Corporation interviewing Viet Cong prisoners of war. She returned to the U.S. in 1968 and now lives in California.<br></p><h2>Analyzing Moral Issues</h2><p><i>Analyzing Moral Issues</i> presents a variety of timely and interesting moral issues through lively introductions and primary source selections.

Lubell&#39;s artistic and literary sources support the argument that from the earliest moments of civilization, humans have respected and revered female sexual energy, graphically symbolized in the vulva, as an indispensable force in the balance of nature. Over the ages, the images of Baubo and her sisters assumed deviant and disturbing forms, but the basic lines of her legend and its visual manifestations were not completely obscured. Nor, as this book will show, has Baubo&#39;s essential power been destroyed even in our own age.</p><p>Winifred Milius Lubell is a noted graphic artist who has developed strong interests in history, mythology, and the imagery of the ancient world. Author or illustrator of more than thirty books, her work has been exhibited in the National Museum of Women in the Arts and in many other galleries throughout this country. Her lifetime interest in Sappho led her to an intensive self-study of classical Greek and ultimately to the subject of this book.Baubo, the bawdy joker of Greek mythology, springs to life in this poetic exploration. Lubell examines ancient literature, artifacts, and iconography to show how a positive image of woman's sexuality was slowly redefined as monstrous. In her examination, she draws upon mythologies as diverse as those of the Irish, Japanese, and Filipinos. Her thesis--that woman's power has been systematically subverted--is far from new, but her subject matter--woman's sexual need--is rarely considered in archetypal studies such as this. Especially provocative are her analyses of the "sacred laughter" necessary to Baubo and of the descent of Medusa from the primeval joker. <i>Pat Monaghan</i></p><h2>Family Law</h2><p>FAMILY LAW, sixth edition, provides a comprehensive introduction to modern family law for the paralegal, covering substantive and procedural law with a strong practical emphasis. In addition to fundamental principles of family law and nationwide legal practices, the book includes state-specific assignments to help you identify relevant laws and regulations in your area. Legal analysis exercises help you apply substantive law principles discussed in each chapter, while sample checklists, forms, documents, cases, and exhibits provide exposure to real-world tools and processes used by working professionals. New content for the sixth edition includes updated coverage of evolving legal issues such as same-sex marriage, adoption, fertility, stem cell research, material on legal ethics, and the role of technology in law.</p><p>William Statsky has been is a member of the ethics committee and the advisory council for the National Federation of Paralegal Associations and a member of the Certifying Board of the National Association of Legal Assistants. He has taught at Columbia Law School, UCLA School of Law, Antioch School of Law and Thomas Edison State College and is the author of numerous groundbreaking legal textbooks for paralegals. He was a member of the transition team for then-President-Elect Ronald Reagan. Mr. Statsky holds a master of law degree (LL.M.) in urban affairs as well as a juris doctorate degree (J.D.).&#34;It is very comprehensive...this comprehensiveness is much appreciated and necessary due to the complexity and depth of the subject matter. The second strength of the textbook is that Statsky presents the material in a very logical sequence which enhances the natural learning process of the students. Often, as a professor, I either have to rearrange my material to follow the order of a textbook&#39;s chapters, or to better facilitate student learning, I sometimes will teach a chapter out of sequence because the material doesn&#39;t logically build on previous material. Neither rearranging my material nor teaching chapters out of sequence is necessary with Statsky&#39;s Family Law, 5th ed., textbook. The text unfolds in an orderly progression from basic to more complex material and covers various family law themes in a logical way. The third strength of the textbook is its emphasis on the contractual aspects of marriage, dissolution, and other family law issues. Family law is fundamentally a type of contract law, and Statsky&#39;s textbook makes that very clear to students.&#34;</p><h2>Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique: A Lacanian Approach for Practitioners</h2><p><p><strong>An introduction to psychoanalytic technique from a Lacanian perspective.</strong></p> What does it mean to practice psychoanalysis as Jacques Lacan did? How did Lacan translate his original theoretical insights into moment-to-moment psychoanalytic technique? And what makes a Lacanian approach to treatment different from other approaches? These are among the questions that Bruce Fink, a leading translator and expositor of Lacan's work, addresses in <em>Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique</em> by describing and amply exemplifying the innovative techniques (such as punctuation, scansion, and oracular interpretation) developed by Lacan to uncover unconscious desire, lift repression, and bring about change.<br><br> Unlike any other writer on Lacan to date, Fink illustrates his Lacanian approach to listening, questioning, punctuating, scanding, and interpreting with dozens of actual clinical examples. He clearly outlines the fundamentals of working with dreams, daydreams, and fantasies, discussing numerous anxiety dreams, nightmares, and fantasies told to him by his own patients. By examining transference and countertransference in detail through the use of clinical vignettes, Fink lays out the major differences (regarding transference interpretation, self-disclosure, projective identification, and the therapeutic frame) between mainstream psychoanalytic practice and Lacanian practice. He critiques the ever more prevalent normalizing attitude in psychoanalysis today and presents crucial facets of Lacan's approach to the treatment of neurosis, as well as of his entirely different approach to the treatment of psychosis.<br><br><em>Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique</em> is an introduction to psychoanalytic technique from a Lacanian perspective that is based on Fink's many years of experience working as an analyst and supervising clinicians, including graduate students in clinical psychology, social workers, psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and psychoanalysts. Designed for a wide range of practitioners and requiring no previous knowledge of Lacan's work, this primer is accessible to therapists of many different persuasions with diverse degrees of clinical experience, from novices to seasoned analysts.<br><br> Fink's goal throughout is to present the implications of Lacan's highly novel work for psychoanalytic technique across a broad spectrum of interventions. The techniques covered (all of which are designed to get at the unconscious, repression, and repetition compulsion) can be helpful to a wide variety of practitioners, often transforming their practices radically in a few short months.</p><p>What does it mean to practice psychoanalysis as Jacques Lacan did?

Bruce Fink's text conveys a systematic, comprehensive summary of the technical implications of the Lacanian approach, which he differentiates from the corresponding technical views of the psychoanalytic mainstream--the ego psychological, Kleinian, and British Independent schools--and from the intersubjective-relational approach. One may agree or disagree with Bruce's formulations, but they open an extremely helpful view of the approach to the clinical psychoanalytic situation from Lacan's perspective, and provide, in the process, a convincing exploration of key Lacanian concepts. This volume should be of definite interest to all psychoanalytic clinicians and educators, and facilitate an overdue, well-formulated scientific debate." <p>-- Otto F.

With his characteristic blend of theoretical rigor, clinical acumen and dry wit, Fink has quite simply reinvented the truth of Lacanian psychoanalysis, and his book will no doubt be as fundamental for a whole generation of scholars and practitioners as the techniques that it sets out to explain and advance." </p><p>-- Dany Nobus, Professor of Psychology and Psychoanalysis, Brunel University. </p><p>"Here readers will find trenchant discussions of a variety of topics central to psychoanalytic practice, such as analytic listening, punctuation, scanding, interpretation, transference and countertransference.

It was with the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> (1943) and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) that she achieved her spectacular success. Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>, <i>The Virtues of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>. They are all available in Signet editions, as is the magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>.Only 12 years after arriving in the United State as a German immigrant with a slim understanding of English, Ayn Rand published THE FOUNTAINHEAD and carved out her legacy. This collection of unfinished and largely developmental short stories offers strong characters with integrity and purpose, and provides some insight into Rand&#39;s growth as a writer. In brief, intimate readings, narrator Bernadette Dunne creates realistic characters with only slight shifts in tone. Most of the stories are written in the first person, and Dunne demonstrates her ability to realize each character without theatrics. Dunne&#39;s voice shifts almost imperceptibly between description and dialogue, and the result is a resonating, unencumbered performance. L.B. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Sons and Lovers (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>This semi-autobiographical novel explores the emotional conflicts through the protagonist, Paul Morel, and the suffocating relationships with a demanding mother and two very different lovers. It is a pre-Freudian exploration of love and possessiveness.</p><p><i>Sons and Lovers</i> was the first modern portrayal of a phenomenon that later, thanks to Freud, became easily recognizable as the Oedipus complex. Never was a son more indentured to his mother's love and full of hatred for his father than Paul Morel, D.H. Lawrence's young protagonist. Never, that is, except perhaps Lawrence himself. In his 1913 novel he grappled with the discordant loves that haunted him all his life--for his spiritual childhood sweetheart, here called Miriam, and for his mother, whom he transformed into Mrs. Morel. It is, by Lawrence's own account, a book aimed at depicting this woman's grasp: "as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers--first the eldest, then the second. These sons are <i>urged</i> into life by their reciprocal love of their mother--urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can't love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives." <p> Of course, Mrs. Morel takes neither of her two elder sons (the first of whom dies early, which further intensifies her grip on Paul) as a literal lover, but nonetheless her psychological snare is immense. She loathes Paul's Miriam from the start, understanding that the girl's deep love of her son will oust her: "She's not like an ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him. She wants to absorb him." Meanwhile, Paul plays his part with equal fervor, incapable of committing himself in either direction: "Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?... And why did he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering, then he hated her--and he easily hated her." Soon thereafter he even confesses to his mother: "I really <i>don't</i> love her. I talk to her, but I want to come home to you."</p><p> The result of all this is that Paul throws Miriam over for a married suffragette, Clara Dawes, who fulfills the sexual component of his ascent to manhood but leaves him, as ever, without a complete relationship to challenge his love for his mother. As Paul voyages from the working-class mining world to the spheres of commerce and art (he has fair success as a painter), he accepts that his own achievements must be equally his mother's. "There was so much to come out of him. Life for her was rich with promise. She was to see herself fulfilled... All his work was hers." </p><p> The cycles of Paul's relationships with these three women are terrifying at times, and Lawrence does nothing to dim their intensity. Nor does he shirk in his vivid, sensuous descriptions of the landscape that offers up its blossoms and beasts and "shimmeriness" to Paul's sensitive spirit. <i>Sons and Lovers</i> lays fully bare the souls of men and earth. Few books tell such whole, complicated truths about the permutations of love as resolutely without resolution. It's nothing short of searing to be brushed by humanity in this manner. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Now printed in full for the first time, Sons and Lovers is one of the great works of twentieth-century literature. In 1913, at the time of its first publication, Lawrence reluctantly agreed to the removal of no fewer than eighty passages which until now have never been restored.</p><h2>A Hermeneutic of Wisdom: Recovering the Formative Agency of Scripture</h2><p>This book develops an integrated hermeneutic that connects the Bible to spiritual formation and the development of Christian virtues. The author shows how the whole Bible can be understood as a wisdom text that directs its readers morally, shapes them in their deepest affections and convictions, and impacts how they look at the world and live in it. Offering an innovative hermeneutical approach, it will serve as an ideal supplement to standard hermeneutics textbooks.</p><p>"Dryden brilliantly synthesizes important truths and insights from sources as hoary as the Hebrew Bible and as fresh as Mark Sneed and Sandra Schneiders. Viewing wisdom as 'a practical knowledge lived out in concrete agency shaped by desire,' Dryden plausibly claims the entirety of Christian Scripture as the locus of his shrewd and savvy reading enterprise. The biblical interpretation workplace today is littered with competing and broken methods. Dryden diagnoses the malaise and draws on classic sources from across the centuries to arrive at a fresh and innovative orientation fleshed out by helpful examples."<br>--<b>Robert&nbsp;W. Yarbrough</b>, Covenant Theological Seminary, St.&nbsp;Louis, Missouri<br><br>"Modern biblical hermeneutics struggles to relate doctrine and ethics, meaning and application in a manner consistent with the Bible's own historical-literary shape and communicative ends. In identifying the Bible as a wisdom text, Dryden's <i>A Hermeneutic of Wisdom </i>offers an integrative approach that helps us better follow the grain of the biblical text while forming rightly ordered loves for God and neighbor."<br>--<b>Scott&nbsp;R. Swain</b>, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando, Florida<br><br>"In an age of many good books on hermeneutics, Dryden's <i>A Hermeneutic of Wisdom</i> truly stands out. Rarely have I encountered an author who so deeply understands and integrates epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and biblical studies. With fair critiques of both modernism and postmodernism, Dryden calls Christians to a thoughtful and faithful engagement with Scripture, not as an object but as God's revealed wisdom aiming at our spiritual formation. Highly recommended!"<br>--<b>Jonathan&nbsp;T. Pennington</b>, Southern Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky<br><br>"Drawing on years of reflection on the formative agency of Scripture, Dryden makes a compelling case for the 'wisdom intentionality' of the whole Bible. Theologians and biblical scholars alike will need to reckon seriously with his central thesis, while pastors and seminarians will resonate with what is a remarkably commonsensical and ecclesial way of reading the Bible. If you want to become a wiser reader of Scripture--better yet, one whose reading bears the fruit of love--then take up and read this book!"<br>--<b>Todd Wilson</b>, senior pastor, Calvary Memorial Church, Oak Park, Illinois<b>J. de Waal Dryden</b> (PhD, Cambridge University) is professor of biblical studies at Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Georgia.

Over centuries, profits from its growth and sales funded wars and fueled colonization, and its cultivation brought about massive changes&#x2015;in land use, labor systems, market practices, and social hierarchies&#x2015;the effects of which are with us even today. <i>A Thirst for Empire</i> takes a vast and in depth historical look at how men and women&#x2015;through the tea industry in Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa&#x2015;transformed global tastes and habits and in the process created our modern consumer society.</p><p>As Erika Rappaport shows, between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries the boundaries of the tea industry and the British Empire overlapped but were never identical, and she highlights the economic, political, and cultural forces that enabled the British Empire to dominate&#x2015;but never entirely control&#x2015;the worldwide production, trade, and consumption of tea. Rappaport delves into how Europeans adopted, appropriated, and altered Chinese tea culture to build a widespread demand for tea in Britain and other global markets and a plantation-based economy in South Asia and Africa. Tea was among the earliest colonial industries in which merchants, planters, promoters, and retailers used imperial resources to pay for global advertising and political lobbying. The commercial model that tea inspired still exists and is vital for understanding how politics and publicity influence the international economy.</p><p>An expansive and original global history of imperial tea, <i>A Thirst for Empire</i> demonstrates the ways that this fluid and powerful enterprise helped shape the contemporary world.</p></p><p><p>"In Erika Rappaport's big, beautifully illustrated book, we have the first global history of how tea became a universal beverage. Rappaport accomplishes this feat by circling the world created by British imperialism, connecting tea pickers, plantation owners, traders, retail shop owners, chain stores, teetotalers, workers on their breaks, and ladies that lunch. Exploring the tea leaf's transformation from plant to drink, Rappaport tells a rigorous, vivid story of the workings of modern capitalism."<b>--Victoria de Grazia, Columbia University</b></p><p>"In this remarkable book covering several centuries and reaching across many continents, Erika Rappaport explores the production, marketing, and consumption of a simple plant and familiar commodity, one that people had to be taught to want. She demonstrates tea's key role shaping colonial and postcolonial worlds, consumerism, politics, and, above all, the cultural, trading, and power relations that made and unmade the British Empire. Ambitious analytical breadth, meticulously researched case studies, and evocative images combine to make this essential and compelling reading."<b>--Geoffrey Crossick, University of London</b></p><p>"This is commodity history at its best. Tea provides a window into a global economy that flourished for many centuries--long before the globalization of our own age. We meet the producers, workers, marketers, and consumers connected to the tea that underpinned empire and postcolonial societies. Rappaport ambitiously takes us from the tea plantation to the metropole and back, capturing a big story in a teacup."<b>--Lizabeth Cohen, author of <i>A Consumers' Republic</i></b></p><p>"<i>A Thirst for Empire</i> is an appealing and wide-ranging new history of tea in the modern world, with a particular emphasis on imperial networks and the role played by marketing and advertising. Sitting at the intersection of imperial history, consumer culture, and the processes of globalization, this book speaks to readers interested in world history as well as those who love their tea."<b>--Frank Trentmann, author of <i>Empire of Things</i></b></p><p>"Positioning tea as the commodity at the heart of this compelling story, <i>A Thirst for Empire</i> demonstrates the ways in which a mass consumer culture emerged between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries in dynamic relations to the rise and fall of the British Empire. This book is monumental in its reach across time and space, and focused in its investigation of how tea was produced, sold, and consumed."<b>--Nadja Durbach, University of Utah</b></p><p>"There are lots of histories of tea out there&#x2014;none, however, offer a similarly sophisticated interpretation and skilled weaving together of such diverse themes, actors, and places. Relying on enormous archival work at sites around the globe, this ambitious book offers an important contribution to understandings of empire, globalization, the rise of consumer culture, and consumer desires."<b>--Abigail McGowan, University of Vermont</b></p><b>Erika Rappaport</b> is professor of history at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Among the simplest and most readily comprehended of Kierkegaard's books, the two works are part of the signed direct communications, as distinguished from his earlier pseudonymous writings. The lucidity and pithiness, and the earnestness and power, of <i>For Self-Examination</i> and <i>Judge for Yourself!</i> are enhanced when, as Kierkegaard requested, they are read aloud. They contain the well-known passages on Socrates' defense speech, how to read, the lover's letter, the royal coachman and the carriage team, and the painter's relation to his painting. The aim of awakening and inward deepening is signaled by the opening section on Socrates in <i>For Self-Examination</i> and is pursued in the context of the relations of Christian ideality, grace, and response. The secondary aim, a critique of the established order, links the works to the final polemical writings that appear later after a four-year period of silence.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Danish"The definitive edition of the <i>Writings</i>.

"The ultimate illustration of how absurdly comical and cancerous <em>The Protocols</em> has been to mankind."&#x2015;Thane Rosenbaum, <em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em></strong></p><em>The Plot</em>, which examines the astonishing conspiracy and the fabrication of <em>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>, has become a worldwide phenomenon since its hardcover publication, taught in classrooms around the globe. Purported to be the actual blueprints by Jewish leaders to take over the world, the <em>Protocols</em>, first published in 1902, have become gospel truth to international millions. Presenting a pageant of historical figures from nineteenth-century Russia to today's ideologues, including Tsar Nicholas II, Henry Ford, and Adolf Hitler, Will Eisner unravels and dispels one of the most devastating hoaxes of the twentieth century.</p><p><p>Born in New York City, <strong>Will Eisner</strong> (1917&#x2013;2005) was the author of the legendary comic strip <em>The Spirit</em>, as well as fifteen graphic novels and three influential instructional textbooks.

He lives in Milan, Italy.</p>Grade 10 Up&#x2013;Published posthumously, this history of the <i>Protocols</i> is based on new evidence from the post-Soviet opening of the Russian archives. Mathieu Golovinski, a Russian aristocrat exiled in France, wrote the work for the secret police, to convince Czar Nicholas II that Jews were behind the political unrest in Russia and to persuade him to abandon liberal reforms. Golovinski plagiarized <i>The Dialogues in Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu</i> (1864), a satirical essay by French attorney Maurice Joly, implying that Napoleon III's plans for France were Machiavellian. Following the stories of Joly and Golovinski, the scene shifts to Constantinople, where a Russian exile offers to sell copies of the <i>Dialogues</i> and the <i>Protocols</i> to a reporter from the <i>London Times</i>. A comparison of the two documents leads to the publication of an article in 1921 exposing the <i>Protocols</i> as a forgery. Despite this revelation, it continued to be used, from the Nazis to Henry Ford to more contemporary hate groups and governments. Eisner appears as a character: researching his book, discussing why the <i>Protocols</i> survive despite repeated debunking, and talking to college students who distribute it. The artwork is occasionally over-the-top; one of Golovinski's superiors is a crazed, Rasputin-like caricature. The side-by-side comparison of sections of the <i>Dialogues</i> and the <i>Protocols</i> is so long that it risks losing readers completely. Despite these flaws, the book is well researched and, for the most part, accomplishes Eisner's goal of making the information available to a wider audience by using a graphic format.<i>&#x2013;Sandy Freund, Richard Byrd Library, Fairfax County, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their central discovery, that weathering makes the "final" state of the construction necessarily indefinite, challenges the conventional notion of a building's completeness. By recognizing the inherent uncertainty and inevitability of weathering and by viewing the concept of weathering as a continuation of the building process rather than as a force antagonistic to it, the authors offer alternative readings of historical constructions and potential beginnings for new architectural projects.</p></p><p>Mohsen Mostafavi is Dean of the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University.<p>This is a delightful and even brilliant essay on a largely neglected theme in architecture. Outside of technical literature, few architectural historians, theorists, or critics have considered the material consequences of the temporal dimension with respect to either the making or the experience of architecture. Leatherbarrow and Mostafavi make this theme a theoretical investigation, in the very best sense of that increasingly problematic enterprise.</p>&#x2015;<b>Alan J. Plattus</b>, Associate Dean, School of Architecture, Yale University<br><br><p>From Ancient Rome to the present, a broad range of examples are marshaled for the purpose of illuminating contemporary practice and understanding. The most profound examples (Palazzo Zuccari, Brion Cemetery) transform the practical necessities into rich metaphor, whereby stains become the basis of light, aging of metamorphosis and renewal. This, finally, is seen to exemplify an approach not only to the processes and meanings of nature, but even more, of history, that is more genuinely creative than the strident calls for wholesale renewal to which we have been periodically subjected.</p>&#x2015;<b>Peter Carl</b>, University of Cambridge</p><h2>Henle Latin I Study Guide Units III - V</h2><p>Henle is the best advanced Latin program, hands down, and this study guide only makes it better.

Down comes the headmaster's birch-rod on the sensitive knuckles of the bumbling pupil. Botch that passage again, lazybones, and I'll have your hide! Poet-novelist Robert Graves and historian Alan Hodge have written a delightful book containing a very quirky 126-page critical history of English prose, a few short chapters listing every conceivable principle of clear &amp; graceful writing, followed by some 200 pages of the most carping, anal-retentive editing &amp; revising you've ever seen. Unlike most style-book authors, who criticize hypothetical or anonymous examples of bad prose, Graves &amp; Hodge courageously tackle many of the biggest names of their era (Hemingway, Aldous Huxley, Bernard Shaw) and relentlessly pick, pick, pick until the carcass is clean and the bones lie strewn about the lair. Then they put it back together again PROPERLY, the way the author should have done it the first time. As G&amp;H themselves note, the book might as well be subtitled "A Short Cut to Unpopularity". Of course, if any headmaster ever treated me the way G&amp;H treat their victims, I'd be outraged. Luckily, we are not one of their hapless victims suffering under their harsh tutelage; so, although we wince in sympathy with those being raked over the coals, we can also profit greatly from their chastisement. "The Reader Over Your Shoulder" is the most painstaking and explicit guide ever published on the craft of revising one's prose. Ideal for self-study. But beware: G&amp;H get under your skin and stay there.</p><p></p><h2>In Search of the Black Fantastic: Politics and Popular Culture in the Post-Civil Rights Era (Transgressing Boundaries: Studies in Black Politics and Black Communities)</h2><p>Prior to the 1960s, when African Americans had little access to formal political power, black popular culture was commonly seen as a means of forging community and effecting political change. <br><br>But as Richard Iton shows in this provocative and insightful volume, despite the changes brought about by the civil rights movement, and contrary to the wishes of those committed to narrower conceptions of politics, black artists have continued to play a significant role in the making and maintenance of critical social spaces. Iton offers an original portrait of the relationship between popular culture and institutionalized politics tracing the connections between artists such as Paul Robeson, Lorraine Hansberry, Richard Pryor, Bob Marley, and Erykah Badu and those individuals working in the protest, electoral, and policy making arenas. With an emphasis on questions of class, gender and sexuality-and diaspora and coloniality-the author also illustrates how creative artists destabilize modern notions of the proper location of politics, and politics itself. <br><br>Ranging from theater to film, and comedy to literature and contemporary music, <em>In Search of the Black Fantastic</em> is an engaging and sophisticated examination of how black popular culture has challenged our understandings of the aesthetic and its relationship to politics.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Iton</strong> is Professor of African American Studies and Political Science at Northwestern University. He is the winner of the 2009 Ralph Bunche Award for <em>In Search of the Black Fantastic</em>, and the 2001 Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award and 2000 Best Book Award on the Social, Cultural, and Ideological Construction of Race from the American Political Science Association for <em>Solidarity Blues: Race, Culture, and the American Left </em>.<br><br>"A fascinating history and analysis of the nexus of black popular culture and activism from the Jazz Age to the hip-hop era...a timely reminder of the significant influence African American artists and entertainers have had on the political front--not necessarily in enacting laws, but in the symbolic impact of words and actions."--<em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"By interweaving many complex issues, <em>In Search of the Black Fantastic</em> moves across the disciplines with ease--politics, history, sociology, American studies, and African American studies--thereby representing one of the most thorough examinations of post-war black culture."--<em>Political Science</em> <em>Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Iton's work possesses the depth of wide reading in modernist theory and the breadth of wide-open eyes and ears for the popular... challenging, illuminating and groundbreaking. For both lay reader and academician, it may well 'compel a revision of our notions of the political.'"--<em>Publishers</em> <em>Weekly</em><p></p><br>"A fresh, meticulously well researched study...The book is grounded in a solid historical base, surveying the dilemmas faced by black artists from the Cold War to the present...I strongly recommend <em>In Search of the Black Fantastic</em> to serious scholars of black literature and culture. By so perceptively engaging the relationship between popular art and the politics of marginalized people, it helps to clear the way to a truer, deeper understanding of an important subject which rarely gets such penetrating analysis."--<em>African American Review</em><p></p><br>"Brimming with ideas... [<em>In Search of the Black Fantastic</em>] offers thought-provoking insights throughout its 400 pages and will certainly stimulate further work in numerous areas of African American history." --<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Iton has committed what many will see as a double professional sin. He has taken the vernacular cultures of black Atlantic people seriously and has used them to produce this deep and stimulating exploration of their political aspirations and achievements. There are exciting and challenging arguments on every single page of this tour de force."--Paul Gilroy, Anthony Giddens Professor of Social Theory, London School of Economics<p></p><br>"Richard Iton's book is an impressive work of scholarship, combining dense analyses of black popular culture with rich insights rooted in political theory. It is a superb contribution to our understanding of the political importance of black popular culture."--Robert Gooding-Williams, Ralph and Mary Otis Isham Professor, University of Chicago<p></p><br>"<em>In Search of the Black Fantastic</em> is a bold and thoroughly original exploration of the knotty relationship between politics and popular culture of the black diaspora during and after the civil rights era. In this learned, eloquent, and persuasively argued book, Richard Iton analyzes the transformative power of a stunning array of cultural forms."--Valerie Smith, Director, Center for African American Studies, Princeton University<p></p><br></p><h2>The Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision (Fundamentals of Cognitive Neuroscience)</h2><p>The Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision begins by introducing the reader to the anatomy of the eye and visual cortex and then proceeds to discuss image and representation, face recognition, printed word recognition, visual sematic memory and visual attention and perception.</p><p>In this clear and engagingly written book, Martha Farah presents the first comprehensive overview of the cognitive neuroscience of vision.

The perception of colour, motion, faces, printed words, and other important components of our visual world are explained, along with the related cognitive processes of visual attention and visual mental imagery.</p> <p>Each chapter brings together a fascinating array of clinical anecdotes and observations, data from physiological experiments, and the latest neuroimaging studies of the normal brain at work. The unprecedented integration of the different stages of visual perception and the different approaches to these stages will be of value to students and specialists alike.</p></p><h2>FDR&#39;s Funeral Train: A Betrayed Widow, a Soviet Spy, and a Presidency in the Balance</h2><p><p>The April 1945 journey of FDR's funeral train became a thousand-mile odyssey, fraught with heartbreak and scandal. As it passed through the night, few of the grieving onlookers gave thought to what might be happening behind the Pullman shades, where women whispered and men tossed back highballs. Inside was a Soviet spy, a newly widowed Eleanor Roosevelt, who had just discovered that her husband's mistress was in the room with him when he died, all the Supreme Court justices, and incoming president Harry S. Truman who was scrambling to learn secrets FDR had never shared with him.</p><p>Weaving together information from long-forgotten diaries and declassified Secret Service documents, journalist and historian Robert Klara enters the private world on board that famous train. He chronicles the three days during which the country grieved and despaired as never before, and a new president hammered out the policies that would galvanize a country in mourning and win the Second World War.</p></p><p><b>Robert Klara</b> is an editor and writer.

Levine has written a masterful study of&nbsp;&nbsp;the first half of the Book of&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbers for the Anchor Bible Commentaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of Numbers--from the numbering&nbsp;&nbsp;or census of the people in the opening&nbsp;&nbsp;chapters--is a much-neglected part of the Torah, the five&nbsp;&nbsp;books of Moses, which constitutes the heart of Holy&nbsp;&nbsp;Scriptures for Jews, while also forming an integral&nbsp;&nbsp;part of the Bible for&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians.<br><br>The Book of Numbers is an account&nbsp;&nbsp;of the young would-be nation of Israel's wanderings&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Wilderness after the magnificent event at&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinai, where Moses speaks with God face-to-face and&nbsp;&nbsp;receives the Ten Commandments. Throughout this&nbsp;&nbsp;time of trial, the people complain, sensing the&nbsp;&nbsp;contrast between the relative security of slavery in&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt, from which they have fled, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;precarious insecurity of freedom in the&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilderness.<br><br>Numbers is a book filled&nbsp;&nbsp;with power struggles, raising questions about who&nbsp;&nbsp;speaks for God, along with personal and communal&nbsp;&nbsp;crises of faith and rumors of revolt. Yet despite&nbsp;&nbsp;the people's blindness and rebelliousness, God&nbsp;&nbsp;remains faithful to the promises made to Israel's&nbsp;&nbsp;ancestors--Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and now Moses--and&nbsp;&nbsp;remains at Israel's side, guiding her slowly but&nbsp;&nbsp;surely to the Promised Land. In all,&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbers describes a terrific journey of&nbsp;&nbsp;discipline and dependence upon the God who liberated&nbsp;&nbsp;the Hebrews from bondage in Egypt: a journey to&nbsp;&nbsp;strengthen Israel for the challenge of a new and&nbsp;&nbsp;wondrous land and the battles she wifl have to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;in order to claim and keep&nbsp;&nbsp;it.<br><br>Despite the importance of The Book of&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbers, its rich collection of stories is&nbsp;&nbsp;not easily assimilated, even by the most&nbsp;&nbsp;conscientious of readers. As such, it requires the help of&nbsp;&nbsp;an expert guide to thread one's way through this&nbsp;&nbsp;mixture of interesting episodes and anecdotes on the&nbsp;&nbsp;one hand, and the many lists, prescriptive rules,&nbsp;&nbsp;ritual regulations, and repeated admonitions on&nbsp;&nbsp;the other. Professor Levine shows us the way into&nbsp;&nbsp;this difficult and sometimes forbidding book of the&nbsp;&nbsp;Bible, and we can be confident of our guide, and&nbsp;&nbsp;secure in the knowledge that the one who led us&nbsp;&nbsp;into the thicket will lead us out again into a broad&nbsp;&nbsp;and fair land.</p><p></p><h2>Mosaicos Volume 1 (6th Edition) - (Standalone Book)</h2><p><p><strong>Note: This is a standalone book and does not include access card/code.<br></strong></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>It&#x2019;s time to talk! ... and have a cultured conversation</strong>.&nbsp; Providing the truly communicative, deeply culture-focused approach instructors believe in along with the guidance and tools students need to be successful using a program with highly communicative goals&#x2014;with <strong>Mosaicos</strong>, there is no need to compromise.&nbsp; Recognizing the primacy of the relationship between culture and language, the new <em>Sixth Edition</em> of&nbsp;<strong>Mosaicos </strong>places culture up front and center, and everywhere in-between!</p></p><p><p> <b>It&#x2019;s time to talk! ... and have a cultured conversation</b>.&nbsp; Providing the truly communicative, deeply culture-focused approach instructors believe in along with the guidance and tools students need to be successful using a program with highly communicative goals&#x2014;with <b>Mosaicos</b>, there is no need to compromise.&nbsp; Recognizing the primacy of the relationship between culture and language, the new <i>Sixth Edition</i> of&nbsp;<b>Mosaicos </b>places culture up front and center, and everywhere in-between!</p><p> <b>Elizabeth E.

Exploiting Germany's own economic burdens, Hitler reached out to the disaffected, turning their aimless discontent into loyal support for his Nazi Party. In Asia, Japan harbored imperial ambitions of its own. The same generation of Americans who battled the Depression eventually had to shoulder arms in another conflict that wreaked worldwide destruction, ushered in the nuclear age, and forever changed their way of life and their country's relationship to the rest of the world.<br><br><em>The American People in World War II</em>--the second installment of Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Freedom from Fear</em>--explains how the nation agonized over its role in the conflict, how it fought the war, why the United States emerged victorious, and why the consequences of victory were sometimes sweet, sometimes ironic. In a compelling narrative, Kennedy analyzes the determinants of American strategy, the painful choices faced by commanders and statesmen, and the agonies inflicted on the millions of ordinary Americans who were compelled to swallow their fears and face battle as best they could. <em>The American People in World War II</em> is a gripping narrative and an invaluable analysis of the trials and victories through which modern America was formed.<br></p><p><br><strong>David M.

In this distressing setting, he meets pimps and prostitutes, pawnbrokers and magicians, policemen and arsonists. He sees social and physiological decomposition as these processes unfold along parallel lines of development. The illusions of existence are nakedly exposed. The narrative erupts in C�line&#x2019;s characteristic elliptical style. His splintered sentences and scatology reflect his fury at the fragmentation of experience and at his own impotence in the face of it. Out of his rage, he forces the meaninglessness back on itself, and the exuberance of his struggle triumphs in the comic exaggeration of satire. Ultimately, his subject is not death but life, and he responds to it by a strengthened commitment to the sensual and concrete.

As with Italy and China, Turkey has a varied landscape that greatly impacts food production. Each region has a deep-rooted history that results in a national cuisine with a wide array of dishes with vastly different ingredients. Despite this, Eckhardt provides a surprisingly familiar list of Turkish pantry staples including red pepper flakes, corn, and herbs such as dill, mint, and thyme. This familiarity carries over to her recipes, such as eggs poached in chunky tomato and pepper sauce, red lentil soup with chile and mint, and tomato and white bean stew.

Making use of a wealth of new material from Russian archives, Geoffrey Roberts challenges a long list of standard perceptions of Stalin: his qualities as a leader; his relationships with his own generals and with other great world leaders; his foreign policy; and his role in instigating the Cold War. While frankly exploring the full extent of Stalin&#x2019;s brutalities and their impact on the Soviet people, Roberts also uncovers evidence leading to the stunning conclusion that Stalin was both the greatest military leader of the twentieth century and a remarkable politician who sought to avoid the Cold War and establish a long-term detente with the capitalist world.<br>By means of an integrated military, political, and diplomatic narrative, the author draws a sustained and compelling personal portrait of the Soviet leader. The resulting picture is fascinating and contradictory, and it will inevitably change the way we understand Stalin and his place in history. Roberts depicts a despot who helped save the world for democracy, a personal charmer who disciplined mercilessly, a utopian ideologue who could be a practical realist, and a warlord who undertook the role of architect of post-war peace.</p><p><b>Geoffrey Roberts</b> is professor of history at the University College Cork, Ireland.

Mr. Bushman, in his penetrating study of colonial Connecticut, takes another view. He shows how, during these years, economic ambition and religious ferment profoundly altered the structure of Puritan society, enlarging the bounds of liberty and inspiring resistance to established authority.</p><p>This is an investigation of the strains that accompanied the growth of liberty in an authoritarian society. Mr. Bushman traces the deterioration of Puritan social institutions and the consequences for human character. He does this by focusing on day-to-day life in Connecticut--on the farms, in the churches, and in the town meetings. Controversies within the towns over property, money, and church discipline shook the "land of steady habits," and the mounting frustration of common needs compelled those in authority, in contradiction to Puritan assumptions, to become more responsive to popular demands.</p><p>In the Puritan setting these tensions were inevitably given a moral significance. Integrating social and economic interpretations, Mr. Bushman explains the Great Awakening of the 1740's as an outgrowth of the stresses placed on the Puritan character. Men, plagued with guilt for pursuing their economic ambitions and resisting their rulers, became highly susceptible to revival preaching.</p><p>The Awakening gave men a new vision of the good society. The party of the converted, the "New Lights," which also absorbed people with economic discontents, put unprecedented demands on civil and ecclesiastical authorities. The resulting dissension moved Connecticut, almost unawares, toward republican attitudes and practices. Disturbed by the turmoil, many observers were, by 1765, groping toward a new theory of social order that would reconcile traditional values with their eighteenth-century experiences.</p><p>Vividly written, full of illustrative detail, the manuscript of this book has been called by Oscar Handlin one of the most important works of American history in recent years.</p></p><p>At the heart of history lies a vague but undeniable substance known as &#x2018;national character&#x2019; or &#x2018;social character&#x2019;... <b>Richard L. Bushman</b> has had the courage to offer his version of the evolution of the social character of Connecticut... The boldness of the attempt alone would make <i>Puritan to Yankee</i> an important book, but it is the general accuracy of its author&#x2019;s perception of the way the mechanism of historical change operates and the specific accuracy of his assessment of the results that makes the book one of the most fruitful historical studies produced in the last few years in any field of history.

Grant and the Civil War. While staying close to his theme of Lincoln as war leader, the book covers its subject from birth to death, depicting him as very much a part of his era, a man who, the author believes, was "our greatest President" and "the one person without whom it is impossible to imagine those trying times." Enhanced throughout with period photographs, reproductions, and direct quotations, and with a fine layout and typography, the narrative is skillfully constructed and expressed in a strong, compelling style. The descriptions of Lincoln's gradual mastery of military strategy and tactics, and his often tense relations with his officers, are riveting, as is Marrin's careful foreshadowing of his subject's assassination. Readers will appreciate the frequent explanations of differences between mid-19th-century political and social mores and those of today. The extensive "Notes" and "More Books About Abraham Lincoln" sections will be useful for further research. Commander in Chief is more focused than Milton Melzer's Lincoln, in His Own Words (Harcourt, 1993) and far more comprehensive than Edward Lindop's summary in the "Presidents Who Dared" series (TFC Bks., 1995). It is the best book on Lincoln for young people since Russell Freedman's Newbery-winning Lincoln (Clarion, 1987).?Starr E.

Moving from theoretical concerns to empirical analysis, he focuses on the crucial role of three institutions that foster protest: black churches, black colleges, and Southern chapters of the NAACP. He concludes that political opportunities, a heightened sense of political efficacy, and the development of these three institutions played a central role in shaping the civil rights movement.

The novel he wrote after his release, based on notes he smuggled out, not only brought him fame, but also founded the tradition of Russian prison writing.<i> Notes from a Dead House&nbsp;</i>(sometimes translated as&nbsp;<i>The House of the Dead</i>) depicts brutal punishments, feuds, betrayals, and the psychological effects of confinement, but it also reveals the moments of comedy and acts of kindness that Dostoevsky witnessed among his fellow prisoners.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To get past government censors, Dostoevsky made his narrator a common-law criminal rather than a political prisoner, but the perspective is unmistakably his own. His incarceration was a transformative experience that nourished all his later works, particularly&nbsp;<i>Crime and Punishment</i>. Dostoevsky&#x2019;s narrator discovers that even among the most debased criminals there are strong and beautiful souls. His story is, finally, a profound meditation on freedom: &#x201c;The prisoner himself knows that he is a prisoner; but no brands, no fetters will make him forget that he is a human being.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><p>Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (1821&#x2013;1881) is best known for the series of novels he wrote in the last twenty years of his life&#x2014;<i>Notes from Underground</i>, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, <i>The Idiot</i>, <i>Demons</i>, <i>The Adolescent</i>, and <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>&#x2014;which made him one of the major figures of Western literature. These works were all nourished by and partly foreshadowed in <i>Notes from a Dead House</i> (1862), the author&#x2019;s semifictional account of his own experiences as a political prisoner in Siberia from 1850 to 1854.<br><br>Together,&nbsp;Richard Pevear&nbsp;and&nbsp;Larissa Volokhonsky&nbsp;have translated works by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Gogol, Bulgakov, and Pasternak.

They are married and live in France.<p>i</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Dead House</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Our prison stood at the edge of the fortress, right by the fortress rampart. You could look at God&#x2019;s world through the chinks in the fence: wouldn&#x2019;t you see at least something? But all you could see was a strip of sky and a high earthen rampart overgrown with weeds, and on the wall sentries pacing up and down day and night, and right then you would think that years would go by, and you would come in the same way to look through the chinks in the fence and see the same rampart, the same sentries, and the same little strip of sky, not the sky over the prison, but a different, far-off, free sky. Picture to yourself a large yard, some two hundred paces long and a hundred and fifty wide, surrounded on all sides, in the form of an irregular hexagon, by a high stockade, that is, a fence of high posts (palings) dug deeply into the ground, their ribs pressed firmly against each other, fastened together by crosswise planks, and sharpened at the tips: this was the outer wall of the prison. On one side of the wall sturdy gates had been set in, always locked, always guarded day and night by sentries; they were opened on demand to let people out to work. Beyond those gates was the bright, free world; people lived like everybody else. But on this side of the wall, you pictured that world as some sort of impossible fairy tale. Here you were in a special world, unlike anything else; it had its own special laws, its own clothing, its own morals and customs, an alive dead house, a life like nowhere else, and special people. It is this special corner that I am setting out to describe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once inside the wall, you see several buildings. On both sides of the wide inner yard stretch two long, one-story log houses. These are the barracks. Here the prisoners live, sorted by categories. Then, deeper into the enclosure, there is another similar house: this is the kitchen, divided into two sections; further on there is another building where there are cellars, barns, and sheds, all under the same roof. The middle of the yard is empty and forms a rather large, level space. Here the prisoners line up for head count and roll call morning, noon, and evening, and occasionally several more times a day&#x2014;depending on the suspiciousness of the sentries and their ability to count quickly. Round about, between the buildings and the fence, there is still quite a lot of space. There, behind the buildings, some inmates of a more unsociable and gloomy character like to walk in their off-hours, shielded from all eyes, and think their own thoughts. Meeting them during these strolls, I liked to peer into their sullen, branded faces, trying to guess what they were thinking about. There was one prisoner whose favorite occupation during his free time was counting the posts. There were about fifteen hundred of them, and he had them all counted up and marked off; each post signified a day for him; each day he counted off one post and in that way, by the number of posts left uncounted, he could actually see how many days of prison he had left before his term was served. He was sincerely glad when he finished some one side of the hexagon. He still had many years to wait; but in prison there was time enough to learn patience. I once saw a prisoner taking leave of his comrades before being released after twenty years in prison. There were people who remembered him entering the prison for the first time, young, carefree, mindful neither of his crime nor of his punishment. He was leaving a gray-haired old man with a sad and gloomy face. He went silently around our six barracks. On entering each barrack, he recited a prayer before the icons, then made a low bow to his comrades, asking them not to remember evil against him.1 I also remember how one prisoner, formerly a well-to-do Siberian peasant, was called to the gates once towards evening. Six months earlier he had received news that his former wife had remarried, and he had been deeply saddened. Now she herself came to the prison, sent for him, and gave him alms. They talked for about two minutes, wept a little, and said good-bye forever. I saw his face when he came back to the barrack&nbsp;. . . Yes, you could learn patience in that place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When darkness fell, we were all brought to the barracks, where we were locked in for the night. I always found it hard to go back to our barrack from outside. It was a long, low, and stuffy room, dimly lit by tallow candles, with a heavy, stifling smell. I don&#x2019;t understand now how I survived for ten years in it. Three planks on the bunk: that was all my space. Some thirty men shared the same bunk in our room alone. In winter they locked up early; it was a good four hours before everybody fell asleep. Meanwhile&#x2014;noise, din, guffawing, swearing, the clank of chains, fumes and soot, shaven heads, branded faces, ragged clothes, everything abused, besmeared&nbsp;. . . yes, man survives it all! Man is a creature who gets used to everything, and that, I think, is the best definition of him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Altogether there were about two hundred and fifty of us in the prison&#x2014;a nearly constant figure. Some came, others finished their terms and left, still others died. And they were all kinds! I think each province, each region of Russia had its representatives here. There were non-Russians, there were even exiles from the Caucasian mountaineers. All this was sorted out according to the severity of the crime and, consequently, to the number of years they were condemned to serve. It must be supposed that there was no crime that did not have its representative here. The main core of all the prison populace consisted of deported convicts of the civilian category (<i>departed</i> convicts, as they na�vely mispronounced it). These were criminals totally deprived of all civil rights, cut-off slices of society, their faces branded in eternal witness to their outcast state. They were sent to hard labor for terms of eight to twelve years and then distributed around various Siberian districts as settlers. There were also criminals of the military category, who were not deprived of civil rights, as is generally the case in penal companies of the Russian army. They were sent for short terms, at the end of which they went back where they came from to serve as soldiers in Siberian battalions of the line. Many of them returned to prison almost at once for repeated serious offenses, not for a short term now, but for twenty years. This category was called &#x201c;perpetual.&#x201d; But the &#x201c;perpetuals&#x201d; were still not totally deprived of civil rights. Finally, there was yet another special category of the most terrible criminals, a rather numerous one, mainly from the military. It was called the &#x201c;special section.&#x201d; Criminals were sent to it from all over Russia. They themselves considered that they were lifers and did not know their term at hard labor. According to the law, their tasks were to be doubled and tripled. They were kept in prison until the heaviest hard-labor sites were opened in Siberia. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in for a term, but we&#x2019;re in for the long haul,&#x201d; they used to say to other inmates. Later I heard that this category had been abolished. Besides that, the civilian order has also been abolished in our fortress, and a single military-prisoner company has been set up. Naturally, along with that the superiors have also been changed. In other words, I am describing old times, things long past and gone&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was long ago now; I see it all as if in a dream. I remember how I entered the prison. It was on an evening in the month of December. Darkness was already falling; people were coming back from work; they were preparing for the roll call. A mustached sergeant finally opened the door for me to this strange house, in which I was to spend so many years, to endure so many sensations, of which, if I had not experienced them in reality, I could never have had even the vaguest notion. For example, could I ever have imagined how terrible and tormenting it would be that, in all the ten years of my term, not once, not for a single minute, would I be alone? . . . At work always under guard, at home with my two hundred comrades, and never once, never once alone! . . . However, that was not all I had to get used to!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here there were chance murderers and professional murderers, robbers and gang leaders. There were petty thieves, and tramps who lived by holdups or by breaking and entering. There were those about whom it was hard to decide what could have brought them there. And yet each of them had his own story, hazy and oppressive, like the fumes in your head after last night&#x2019;s drunkenness. Generally, they spoke little of the past, did not like to tell and clearly tried not to think about what had been. I even knew murderers among them so cheerful, so never-thoughtful, that you could wager their conscience had never reproached them at all. But there were also the gloomy ones, who were almost always silent. Generally, it was rare that anyone told about his life, and curiosity was not in fashion, was somehow not the custom, was not acceptable. Though on rare occasions someone would start talking out of idleness, and another man would listen coolly and gloomily. No one could surprise anyone here. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re literate folk!&#x201d; they often said, with some strange self-satisfaction. I remember how a drunken robber (you could occasionally get drunk in prison) once began telling about how he killed a five-year-old boy, how he lured him first with a toy, took him to some empty shed, and there put a knife in him. The whole barrack, which until then had laughed at his jokes, cried out like one man, and the robber was forced to shut up; they did not cry out in indignation, but just so, because he <i>shouldn&#x2019;t</i> have talked <i>about that;</i> because it was not acceptable to talk <i>about that.</i> I will note by the way that these people were indeed literate and that not in a figurative but in the literal sense. Certainly more than half of them could read and write. In what other place where Russian folk gather in large numbers could you find a group of two hundred and fifty people more than half of whom were literate? As I heard later, someone concluded from similar data that literacy ruins the people. That is a mistake: the causes here are quite different, though it is impossible not to agree that literacy develops self-assurance in people. But that is by no means a shortcoming. The categories were distinguished by their clothing: some had jackets half dark brown and half gray, and their trousers as well&#x2014;one leg gray, the other dark brown. At work once, a girl who sold rolls came up to the prisoners, studied me for a long time, and then suddenly burst out laughing. &#x201c;Pah, what a sight!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Not enough gray cloth, and not enough black!&#x201d; There were some whose jackets were all of gray cloth, and only the sleeves were dark brown. Our heads were also shaved differently: some had half the head shaved lengthwise, and others crosswise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At first glance you could notice a rather strong similarity in this strange family; even the most distinct, most original personalities, who reigned over the others involuntarily, tried to fall into the general tone of the whole prison. In general I must say that all these people, with the exception of a few inexhaustibly cheerful ones, who were held up to universal scorn because of it, were gloomy, envious, terribly vain, boastful, touchy, and formalists in the highest degree. The ability to be surprised at nothing was considered the greatest virtue. They were all mad about keeping up appearances. But not infrequently the most arrogant look changed with lightning speed to the most pusillanimous. There were several truly strong men; they were simple and unaffected. But, strangely enough, among these truly strong men there were a few who were vain to the utmost degree, almost to the point of sickness. In general, vanity and appearances took the foreground. The majority were depraved and terribly degenerate. There was ceaseless gossip and scandal-mongering: it was hell, pitch-darkness. Yet no one dared to rebel against the internal statutes and accepted customs of the prison; everyone submitted. There were outstanding characters who submitted with difficulty, with effort, but submitted all the same. Such men came to the prison as had gone all too far, who had leaped beyond all measure in freedom, so that in the end they committed their crimes as if not of themselves, as if not knowing why, as if in delirium, in a daze; often out of a vanity chafed in the highest degree. But with us they were reined in at once, though some of them had been the terror of whole villages and towns before coming to prison. As he looked around, the newcomer would soon realize that he had landed in another place, that here there was nobody to surprise, and he would humble himself imperceptibly and fall in with the general tone. Outwardly, this general tone consisted of a sort of special personal dignity that pervaded almost every inhabitant of the prison. As if the title of convict, of condemned man, constituted some sort of rank, and an honorable one at that. No signs of shame and repentance! However, there was also a sort of outward, so to speak, official humility, a sort of calm philosophizing: &#x201c;We&#x2019;re lost folk,&#x201d; they would say. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t know how to live in freedom, now stroll down the green street and inspect the ranks.&#x201d;2 &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t listen to your father and mother, now you can listen to the drumhead&#x2019;s leather.&#x201d; &#x201c;You thought gold embroidery was no fun, now crush stones till your time is done.&#x201d; This was all oft repeated, both by way of admonition and as ordinary proverbs and sayings, but never seriously. It was all just words. Hardly a one of them acknowledged his lawlessness to himself. Let someone who was not from among the convicts try reproaching a prisoner for his crime and abusing him (though it&#x2019;s not in the Russian spirit to reproach a criminal)&#x2014;there would be no end of cursing. And what masters at cursing they all were! Theirs was a refined, artistic cursing. They raised cursing to the level of a science; they tried to bring it off not so much by an insulting word as by an insulting meaning, spirit, idea&#x2014;that was more subtle, more venomous. Incessant quarrels had developed this science still more among them. All these people worked under the lash, consequently they were idle, consequently they were depraved: if they were not depraved before, they became so at hard labor. They had not gathered here by their own will; they were all strangers to each other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The devil wore out three pair of boot soles before he got us heaped together!&#x201d; they said of themselves; and therefore gossip, intrigue, old wives&#x2019; slander, envy, squabbles, and spite were always in the foreground of this hellish life. No old wife could be so much an old wife as some of these murderers. I repeat, there were strong men among them, characters who all their lives were accustomed to crushing and domineering, hardened, fearless. These men were somehow involuntarily respected; they, for their part, though often very jealous of their reputation, generally tried not to be a burden to anyone, did not get into empty quarrels, behaved with extraordinary dignity, were reasonable and al...</p></p><h2>Nelson&#39;s Quick Reference Bible Concordance (Nelson&#39;s Quick Reference Series)</h2><p><p>End the frustration of being unable to locate a Scripture, find a biblical word definition, or get a historical fact when you need it.

Drawing on vast data sets and cutting-edge research, he explains the benign and malign forces that make inequality rise and fall within and among nations. He also reveals who has been helped the most by globalization, who has been held back, and what policies might tilt the balance toward economic justice.</p><p><i>Global Inequality</i> takes us back hundreds of years, and as far around the world as data allow, to show that inequality moves in cycles, fueled by war and disease, technological disruption, access to education, and redistribution. The recent surge of inequality in the West has been driven by the revolution in technology, just as the Industrial Revolution drove inequality 150 years ago. But even as inequality has soared <i>within</i> nations, it has fallen dramatically <i>among</i> nations, as middle-class incomes in China and India have drawn closer to the stagnating incomes of the middle classes in the developed world. A more open migration policy would reduce global inequality even further.</p><p>Both American and Chinese inequality seems well entrenched and self-reproducing, though it is difficult to predict if current trends will be derailed by emerging plutocracy, populism, or war. For those who want to understand how we got where we are, where we may be heading, and what policies might help reverse that course, Milanovic&#x2019;s compelling explanation is the ideal place to start.</p></p><p>Branko Milanovic is Visiting Presidential Professor and Core Faculty at the Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality at the Graduate Center, City University of New York. He was formerly Lead Economist in the World Bank&#x2019;s research department. His books include <i>Global Inequality</i> (Harvard) and <i>The Haves and the Have-Nots: A Brief and Idiosyncratic History of Global Inequality</i>.&#x201c;The data [Milanovic] provides offer a clearer picture of great economic puzzles, and his bold theorizing chips away at tired economic orthodoxies.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Economist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this fascinating book, Milanovic is able to articulate the study of inequality between and within countries in the clearest possible way.

Milanovic concludes that inequality is rising within most countries, although global inequality, albeit huge, has been falling. Unfortunately, he sees no end to the current upswing in inequality in the high-income countries. That creates disturbing political dangers.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Martin Wolf</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Milanovic] makes a case that the rapid growth of poorer countries since 1988 has brought the first decline in inequality since the Industrial Revolution...The very rich or the very corrupt may still hide their wealth in tax havens. Politicians in developed countries may decry rising inequality. But global trends and new data tell an alternative story about the progress already made to lift the poor.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Branko Milanovi&#x107;&#x2019;s much underestimated <i>Global Inequality: A New Approach for the Age of Globalization</i>, now being published in many languages, tells us more than any other recent book about the state of the world we live in and, at a time when hope is so urgently needed, offers us thought-provoking insights into the world we could become.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gordon Brown</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Continuing with his extraordinarily important work on the empirics of global inequality, Branko Milanovic in this book expands on that work to lay the basis for a more theoretical understanding of the evolution of inequality. It is seen to be the product of two forces: Kuznets cycles of rising and decreasing within-nation inequalities, and convergence of mean incomes among countries. The relative strength of these two forces has profound political implications: Shall we live in the world of class cleavages, or of huge international income gaps? Is the world to be ruled by the global top 1 percent, or by a large global middle class?&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joseph Stiglitz, Columbia University</b><br><br>&#x201c;[Milanovic] believes that growing inequality within countries will not threaten capitalism as a system for allocating economic resources but will pose a serious threat to liberal democracy. As middle classes everywhere get squeezed, the United States will become even more plutocratic, and nativistic populism will become more mainstream in Europe&#x2015;a process that is already under way, aided in no small part by the influx of migrants, a feature of globalization that is likely to only intensify.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard N.

As you would expect from one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on this topic, Milanovic has added significantly to important recent works by Thomas Piketty, Anthony Atkinson, and Fran�ois Bourguignon...Ever-rising inequality looks a highly unlikely combination with any genuine democracy. It is to the credit of Milanovic&#x2019;s book that it brings out these dangers so clearly, along with the important global successes of the past few decades.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Martin Wolf</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Milanovic offers us not just a plethora of facts about income inequality that will surely make his readers think twice.

Downing, Ph.D., </b>was a national leader in the field of special education who focused her expertise, time, and energy researching best practices and advocating for individuals with severe and multiple disabilities. She was a steadfast promoter of inclusive education, viewing access to the general education program and peers without disabilities as best practice, as well as an issue of social equality and civil rights. Dr. Downing was an exceptionally productive scholar who published numerous articles, chapters, monographs, and textbooks focusing on the education and inclusion of students with severe and multiple disabilities. Her publications are used by many educators and parents to learn how to provide quality education in inclusive classrooms to students with severe and multiple disabilities. Dr. Downing provided numerous professional development trainings in many regions of the world and served as the keynote speaker at several national and international conferences. She was known for her practical, invigorating, and humorous presentations and workshops. Dr. Downing's career in the field of special education began as a teacher of students with visual impairments and multiple disabilities including deafblindness. She was Associate Professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson and Professor at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). She directed or codirected several federally funded personnel preparation, research-to-practice, and technical assistance projects and was committed to preparing exceptional, highly qualified teachers, whose role she saw as change agents for the future. Through Dr. Downing's teaching and hands-on guidance, her students developed a passion for teaching and a strong commitment to supporting quality lives for students with disabilities and their families. While at CSUN, Dr. Downing contributed to the development of the CHIME Institute's Charter School and was instrumental in its high-quality inclusive educational practices. Dr. Downing served on the National TASH Board of Directors for six years and was Past President of Cal-TASH and AZ-TASH (the California and Arizona state chapters of TASH). She also served as an associate editor of <i>Research and Practices for Persons with Severe Disabilities. </i>Dr. Downing retired from CSUN in 2007 and returned to Tucson, where she lived until her death in July 2011. Her indomitable spirit, passion, and determination have been a driving force in our field, and her work continues to inspire and create positive and successful learning outcomes for students.</p><br><p>Copyright�2005 by Paul H.

Every time at least two people come together, communication can occur. Although all human beings communicate, some individuals, due to the severity of their disabilities, may have limited communication skills. Individuals with severe and multiple disabilities may not have full access to or full control of the multiple means by which most individuals communicate (e.g., speech, facial expressions, body language, print). This inability to express themselves as others would does not mean that these individuals have nothing to say, nor does it diminish their need and right to communicate. Teachers and other service providers must respect this desire to communicate, using their expertise, experience, and commitment to make communication possible. Taking the stance that everyone has something to say is the least dangerous assumption and demonstrates the greatest level of respect (Cardinal, 2002). This chapter highlights the importance of supporting all communicative efforts of individuals who do not use speech as their primary mode of communication.</p><b>WHO IS THE TARGET POPULATION FOR THIS BOOK?</b><br><br><p>Many students with disabilities experience difficulties communicating. Emotional disorders can interfere with effective communication, especially in unfamiliar and stressful situations. Individuals with autism and severe developmental delays, as well as those with severe sensory impairments (vision or hearing or both; Arthur, 2003; Heller, Alberto, &amp; Bowdin, 1995), may also find it difficult to communicate effectively. Certainly, a severe physical disability, especially when it is in addition to an intellectual impairment, can hinder the development of speech and language. The intricate physical movements of the oral musculature required for speech are negatively affected by a severe physical disability, and a severe intellectual impairment makes it very difficult for the individual to associate symbols with their referents. Individuals with severe cognitive disabilities often have difficulty acquiring an abstract means of communication, such as speech or American Sign Language (ASL). Essentially, any child who has a disability that interferes with the normal acquisition and development of language will experience difficulties in communicative exchanges (both receptively and expressively).</p><p>Some individuals have acquired a few speech skills that enable them to express basic concepts (e.g., requesting a desired food or activity). Limitations in using complex language patterns, however, hamper more abstract communication (e.g., discussing dreams, concerns, and/or future plans). Even though these individuals may have multiple means of communicating without abstract symbols, the ability to clearly express more complex thoughts and feelings is not possible without the use of some kind of system of representative symbols.</p><p>This book addresses the needs of children and youth whose severe disabilities make even the most basic interactions difficult. Many of these children use alternative forms of communication in their efforts to understand and be better understood by others. Because this is a large and extremely heterogeneous group of individuals, information in this book concentrates on those children and youth (ages 3&#x2013;22) who receive their education in age-appropriate general education classes with the support of teachers, classmates, paraprofessionals, parents, administrators, and related services providers. General education classrooms afford both students and teachers with incredible opportunities for learning (Downing, 2002; Fisher &amp; Meyer, 2002; Renzaglia, Karvonen, Drasgow, &amp; Stoxen, 2003; Soto, Muller, Hunt, &amp; Goetz, 2001) and, therefore, general education will be the premise of this text. Much of the information presented in this text, however, also has applicability to other natural environments such as the home, the workplace, and other community facilities. Thus, communication interventions for students who need them are strongly recommended no matter where the students are educated.</p><b>WHAT IS COMMUNICATION?</b><br><br><p>Communication occurs when one individual sends a message to another and that message is received and understood (Butterfield &amp; Arthur, 1995). Competence in a symbolic and abstract language system (e.g., spoken English or Spanish, manual ASL), with formalized rules of word representation, production, and use, is not a prerequisite for communication. In fact, one can be quite adept with a spoken language and not communicate at all if there is no one to talk to, no one present who understands the spoken language used, or no one who is attending to or hearing the message. A request for directions in a foreign country or an interaction with a preoccupied teenager illustrates these points. </p> Just as the presence of language does not necessarily mean that communication will follow, the absence of language does not always mean that communication cannot occur. In fact, those not using language can communicate quite well at times. For example, graduate students putting away their papers and pens let the professor know that class has ended; rumbling stomachs and glazed eyes let the principal know that the meeting is over (or should be); and the fidgety behavior of young children who need to go to the bathroom is easily recognized. For all of these situations and countless others, the absence of symbolic language behavior is irrelevant. In fact, as much as 90% of any message exchanged between two very verbal people can be attributed to nonverbal behavior (Evans, Hearn, Uhlemann, &amp; Ivey, 2003). In addition, many nonverbal communicative behaviors are universal, recognized, and understood despite cultural and linguistic differences (Ekman, 1980, 2003; Izard, 1994). Recognizing the power of nonsymbolic yet highly communicative behavior (e.g., facial expressions, body movements, gestures) is critical for those interested in facilitating the communication skill development of students who are unable to master symbolic languages. Such behaviors form the foundation for enhanced communicative interactions (Cress, 2002; Dennis, 2002) because, unlike speech, they are easier to shape and, therefore, easier to learn.<p></p><b>WHO NEEDS COMMUNICATION INTERVENTION?</b><br><br><p>When students demonstrate such minimal communication skills that they are not adequately expressing themselves, others tend to assume that they have nothing to communicate or simply do not care about anything. Unfortunately, such assumptions are dangerous because they dehumanize the student, casting him or her in an extremely dependent and vulnerable position (Biklen, 1993; Cardinal, 2002; Kochmeister, 1997). Following the least dangerous assumption, it is always preferable to perceive all students, regardless of the severity of the disability, as individuals who have something to say but who have extreme difficulty making their thoughts heard and understood by others. With this latter assumption, it is the responsibility of those who communicate with greater ease to do whatever they can to help the student understand what is being said and to find a way to give him or her a voice.</p><p>Operating on the assumption that all individuals need to communicate, the tendency to wait until certain prerequisite skills are demonstrated before providing helpful intervention makes little sense. Communication is a defining characteristic of all of us, with breathing as the only real prerequisite (Mirenda, 1993). The question, then, should not be whether students with severe disabilities will benefit from communication intervention but rather how best to provide that support.</p><p>Unfortunately, practitioners in several states continue to spend valuable time and energy determining eligibility for communication intervention services. Every day, then, many parents and teachers express their frustration at being unable to gain access to quality speech-language services for their children or students who do not speak. When speech becomes a prerequisite for communication intervention, many students with severe disabilities will be denied important support. Several states adhere to a model of cognitive referencing to determine eligibility for intervention services (Notari, Cole, &amp; Mills, 1992). Cognitive referencing is the practice of identifying a discrepancy between a child's cognitive and language abilities to qualify for services. For children with severe intellectual challenges who are determined to have similarly limited speech-language and cognitive abilities, some may consider communication services to be irrelevant. Presumably, these children would not benefit from intervention. However common this approach may be, the belief that children with equal delays in both language and cognitive development are not able to benefit from language intervention has not been substantiated (Cole &amp; Mills, 1997; Cress &amp; Marvin, 2003). In a report to the National Joint Committee for the Communication Needs of Persons with Severe Disabilities, Snell and colleagues provided a strong rebuttal to the many rationalizations used to avoid serving students with severe disabilities (Snell et al., 2003). Based on a long list of reasons to deny services (e.g., age, discrepancy between cognitive and communicative ability, absence of prerequisite skills), these experts made it quite clear that all individuals with complex communication needs require and benefit from quality services. By their very need to communicate they qualify for services.</p><b>CHARACTERISTICS OF COMMUNICATION</b><br><br><p>As stated previously, communication by definition requires at least two people &#x2014; a sender of the message and a receiver &#x2014; who understand each other. Having appropriate communication partners constitutes the essential social aspect of communication. Other critical components of communication include form (i.e., a way to send the message), content (i.e., something to talk about), and a reason or purpose to communicate (Beukelman &amp; Mirenda, 2005). Beyond these basic conditions, no specific skill level is needed. Given such characteristics, it is easy to see how everyone can and does communicate; however, students with severe disabilities may find themselves in situations in which competent social partners are not present (e.g., a self-contained special education classroom), and the behaviors (form) they have to use for communication are not clear to others. In addition, these individuals may have severely limited life experiences, leaving little to talk about (content) and little reason to communicate (when all needs are anticipated in advance). Educational team members, therefore, must ensure that these aspects of communication are addressed.</p><b>Social Aspect</b><br><br><p>One major difficulty for students with severe disabilities who are educated in special education classrooms is that they tend to have extensive interactions with adults but limited interactions with other students (Foreman, Arthur-Kelly, Pascoe, &amp; King, 2004; Simpson, Beukelman, &amp; Sharpe, 2000; White, Garrett, Kearns, &amp; Grisham-Brown, 2003). Not only can this lack of social opportunity make it difficult for students with severe disabilities to learn the skills of communication, but also it can interfere with their ability to make friends (Geisthart, Brotherson, &amp; Cook, 2002; Richardson, 2002). In special education classrooms composed solely of students with similar communication difficulties, the brunt of the responsibility for being a responsive communicative partner falls to the teacher or another adult in the room. Because the adult usually must attend to a number of students, all needing considerable support, opportunities for meaningful communication with individual students are limited. Foreman and his colleagues (2004) compared the social-communicative interactions of students with profound and multiple disabilities in special classrooms with those of similarly matched students in general education classrooms. They found that the students with disabilities in general education were involved in significantly higher levels of communication interactions than were their matched pair in special classrooms. These researchers also found that classmates without disabilities were involved in significantly more interactions with their peers with disabilities in general education than in special education.</p><p>When students with disabilities are full-time members of general education classrooms, the other students in the class serve as communicative partners. In fact, these students may have a better perspective given the closeness in age to a classmate with severe disabilities and may therefore be better able to understand what their classmate is trying to say. Certainly, they serve as more effective (more age-appropriate) models for communication skills (Davern, Schnorr, &amp; Black, 2003; Janney &amp; Snell, 1996; Soto &amp; von Tetzchner, 2003). Furthermore, communicating with peers is a more direct way for a student to achieve friendships than learning communication skills first with a teacher and then having to transfer those skills to an interaction with a peer. As an added benefit, students without disabilities acquire a better understanding of diversity and learn ways to interact with those who have disabilities.</p><b>Form of Communication</b><br><br><p>Individuals need some identifiable form of communication to effectively convey a message. Sometimes the form or forms used by the individual is very clear (e.g., spoken language, signs, universally understood gestures). Sometimes forms of communication are more difficult to discern. For individuals with the most severe and complex disabilities, the form used may be more difficult to interpret (e.g., fast breathing to indicate no; smooth, easy breathing to say yes). The forms of communication used by the individual must be understood by his or her recipient or they fail to be communicative. Therefore, highly idiosyncratic forms of communication may require a fair degree of interpretation by the communication partner.</p><p>Professionals in the field of communication disorders generally recognize the multimodal nature of communication (Beukelman &amp; Mirenda, 2005; Blackstone &amp; Berg, 2003; Reichle, 1997). No one form of communication will suffice to meet all needs or all social expectations of a given situation. With multiple ways to convey messages, more options are available for choosing a communicative alternative that fits each individual. For example, some students with severe disabilities may not hear or understand speech because of difficulties processing auditory information. These individuals, however, may benefit from receiving messages visually &#x2014; for example, through pictures, photographs, or natural gestures (Alberto &amp; Fredrick, 2000; Copeland &amp; Hughes, 2000; Mirenda &amp; Erickson, 2000). Conversely, students with limited or no vision may do well with simple speech and representative objects or parts of objects to feel. For students who cannot rely on speech to convey messages clearly, t...</p></p><h2>Tested in the Trenches: A 9-Step Plan for Building and Sustaining a Million-Dollar Financial Services Practice</h2><p>Build a great financial services practice, AND a great life filled with passion, purpose and enthusiasm.<p>With more than one million financial services practitioners in the United States and Canada, competition for clients can be intense.

In this brilliant and eagerly awaited study, Chadwick explores the issues relating to the conditions under which women have worked as artists from the Middle Ages to the present. Illustrated.</p><p>Whitney Chadwick is an art historian. She is the author of Women Artists and the Surrealist Movement and Women, Art and Society.Like many women artists of the time, Gentileschi and Sirani were the daughters of painters. Orazio Gentileschi was one of the most important of Caravaggio&#39;s followers; Giovanni Andrea Sirani a pupil and follower of Reni, and an artist of considerably less interest than his daughter. Gentileschi is the first woman artist in the history of Western art whose historical significance is unquestionable. In the case of Sirani, her early death has prevented a full evaluation of her career despite her evident fame during her life. Sirani&#39;s father took all of her income from a body of work which she herself, following a custom gaining favor during the seventeenth century, catalogued at 150 paintings, a figure now considered too low. Despite her catalogue, no monograph exists and her reputation has suffered from an over-attribution of inferior works in Reni&#39;s style to her.</p><h2>Stepford Wives</h2><p>The women of Stepford are not all that they seem...All the beautiful people live in idyllic Stepford, Connecticut, an affluent, suburban Eden populated with successful, satisfied hubbies and beautiful, dutiful wives.

But just beneath the town&#39;s flawless surface, something is sordid and wrong - something abominable with roots in the local Men&#39;s Association. And it may already be too late for Joanna to save herself from being devoured by Stepford&#39;s hideous perfection.</p><p>Ira Levin is the author of The Boys from Brazil, Sliver, The Stepford Wives, and other bestsellers, as well as Broadway&#39;s longest-running thriller, Deathtrap.

He calls these low-income neighborhoods &#x201c;sacrifice zones.&#x201d; And he argues that residents of these sacrifice zones, tainted with chemical pollutants, need additional regulatory protections.</p><p><i>Sacrifice Zones</i> goes beyond the disheartening statistics and gives us the voices of the residents themselves, offering compelling portraits of accidental activists who have become grassroots leaders in the struggle for environmental justice and details the successful tactics they have used on the fenceline with heavy industry.</p></p><p>Steve Lerner is the author of <i>Eco-Pioneers: Practical Visionaries Solving Today's Environmental Problems</i> (1998) and <i>Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor </i>(2006), both published by the MIT Press.This book will break your heart. Lerner, who plumbed the depths of Louisiana&#x2019;s suffering in Diamond (2005), focuses on how 12 American communities are affected by their close proximity to polluted industrial sites. The facts speak for themselves as he recounts data collected in legal cases and interviews with dozens of people from each locale, and you cannot help but become emotionally involved in each outcome. The clear message is that low-income neighborhoods (the &#x201c;sacrifice zones&#x201d; of the title) suffer disproportionately from industrial toxins, and it is hard to argue the point after reading about what everyone from Exxon Mobil to the Department of Defense (ironically the biggest polluter in America) has done to its residential neighbors. In most cases residents do not want industry to go away, they want it to abide by existing regulations and for regulators to do their jobs. This is the heart-breaking part, because Lerner exposes just how easily rules are ignored. One might want this book to be easy to ignore, but instead, it&#x2019;s unforgettable. And devastating. --Colleen Mondor</p><h2>The Validation Breakthrough: Simple Techniques for Communicating with People with &#39;Alzheimer&#39;s-Type Dementia&#39;</h2><p>Arguing that as the elderly lose contact with the outside world, they turn inward and to the past to work through unresolved emotional issues from their lives, Naomi Feil presents her method for therapeutically dealing with patients with Alzheimer&#39;s and other dementias.</p><p></p><h2>Work of E.H.

Or were Jews under Muslim rule persecuted, much as they were in Christian lands? Rejecting both polemically charged "myths," Mark Cohen offers a systematic comparison of Jewish life in medieval Islam and Christendom--the first in-depth explanation of why medieval Islamic-Jewish relations, though not utopic, were less confrontational and violent than those between Christians and Jews in the West.</p></p><p><b>Mark R. Cohen</b> is Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University. His books include <i>Jewish Self-Government in Medieval Egypt</i> and <i>The Autobiography of a Seventeenth-Century Venetian Rabbi,</i> both published by Princeton University Press.A thorough comparative study of the conditions of medieval Jewish life in Christian and Muslim lands. Cohen (Near Eastern Studies/Princeton) explores and explodes the recently resurrected myth of Arabs and Jews living in an ``interfaith utopia,'' especially during the centuries of Islam's ascendancy. This fantasy of a tolerant Golden Age in Spain before 1492 (when Jews were expelled) is (European) Jewish in origin, but it gets a lot of spin from propagandists trying to show that Muslims can be anti-Zionists but have never been anti-Jewish. Among the scores of primary sources quoted here is a letter from Jewish philosopher-physician Maimonides (d. 1204), who writes that ``none has matched [Islam] in debasing and humiliating us.'' Cohen modifies such statements and battles the ``countermyth'' of Arab savagery held by contemporary Sephardic Jews, who he views as competing with their Holocaust-surviving Ashkenazic counterparts. Before the 17th century, the frequency and harshness of both Christian and Muslim persecution is about equal, but Cohen deftly differentiates between the behavior of these two hosts by studying the particular economic and social conditions of various Jewish communities under different caliphs and kings. He analyzes all the decrees (Jews had to rise in the presence of Muslims) and restrictions (Jews could not own Christian land) with condiderable historical and theological insight. Early Christians, facing life- and-death competition with Jews in the Roman empire, developed an adversarial faith that ``fulfilled'' Judaism and ``demonized'' Jews. Consequently, treatment of Jews in Christendom ranged from serfdom to expulsion. Mohammed's minions had no ongoing struggle with Arabia's quickly subjugated Jews, hence Christian and Jewish ``people of the book'' were ``second-class subjects'' but allowed some occupational diversity. For an academic study of the Middle Ages, remarkably accessible and timely. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is identical to "Oneness," by Rasha, and not a different book.</strong><br><br>In February, 1998, Rasha had her first dialogue with the universal presence "Oneness." This conversation began a profound relationship in which the teachings of Oneness were communicated. As Oneness guided her step-by-step through the agonies and the exultation of an experiential voyage to God-realization, Rasha painstakingly documented the principles that are the foundation for a new level of understanding of the phenomenon we call "life." In unprecedented revelations, Oneness provides humanity with a startling new vision of the true nature of who we are and the world around us. This is a world where the rules that support our belief systems and form the basis of our so-called "scientific proof" are changing before our very eyes. Through Oneness, we learn how reality is manifested through vibrations and how our emotional responses draw our life experiences to us. The symptoms of the process of ascension - the shifting of our awareness into accelerating levels of reality - are all around us. Oneness guides us in recognizing these signs and maximizing their potential. This book takes us to the outer reaches of our own humanness and to the depths of Divinity within, andputs enlightenment within the reach of everyone. In the process, we realize the significance of the choice each of us has made to be here in these extraordinary times.<br></p><p>Healer and author RASHA has served as a conduit of Divine guidance since 1987. She has appeared as a speaker across the United States, addressing the profound spiritual awakening that is a hallmark of these times.

When high oil prices and economic competition from Japan and Germany battered the American economy, new policies&#x2014;both international and domestic&#x2014;became necessary. But war was waged against inflation, rather than against unemployment, and the government promoted a balanced budget instead of growth. This, says Stein, marked the beginning of the age of finance and subsequent deregulation, free trade, low taxation, and weak unions that has fostered inequality and now the worst recession in sixty years. </p><p>Drawing on extensive archival research and covering the economic, intellectual, political, and labor history of the decade, Stein provides a wealth of information on the 1970s. She also shows that to restore prosperity today, America needs a new model: more factories and fewer financial houses.</p></p><p><b>Judith Stein</b> is professor of history at the City College and Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

It contains <b>Right Ho, Jeeves</b>, <b>The Inimitable Jeeves</b> and <b>Very Good, Jeeves</b>.</p><p>P. G. Wodehouse (1881-1975) is an English-born storyteller and journalist who came to America before World War I and sold a serial to the Saturday Evening Post, where most of his books first appeared. Though Wodehouse wrote more than 90 books and 20 film scripts, and collaborated on more than 30 plays and musical comedies, he is perhaps best known as the creator of the gentlemanly character Jeeves, "that subtle master of prudence, good taste, and ineffable composure." This three-part edition will delight newcomers to Wodehouse as well as those already familiar with his "sunny universe and sparkling prose." Let the reader beware: unless you are the kind of person who enjoys being stared at, do not attempt to read anything by P. G. Wodehouse in public. If you do, you'll soon find yourself an object of interest on the bus, plane or train as you attempt to stifle guffaws or end up accidentally swallowing your tongue in a useless effort to squash that belly-laugh. Wodehouse is, quite simply, one of the funniest men on the planet, and this latest compendium of his work, <i>Life with Jeeves</i>, is Wodehouse at his best. <p> Here you'll find Bertie Wooster, a complete gentleman, but the first to admit he's a bit of a chump; his valet, Jeeves, infinitely sagacious, the source of all solace; and a wild collection of terrifying aunts, miserly uncles, love-sick friends, female authors, crusading communists, troublesome cousins, cantankerous dogs, unwanted fianc�s and more-all bound up in plots as impossibly labyrinthine as they are laugh-out-loud funny.</p>Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (always known as `Plum&#39;) wrote more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories over 73 years. He is widely recognised as the greatest 20th-century writer of humour in the English language. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for `having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world&#39;. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died shortly afterwards, on St Valentine&#39;s Day.</p><h2>Every Man a Tiger</h2><p>Combining military history and biography, a profile of General Chuck Horner, commander of the allied air forces during the Persian Gulf War, discusses the tactics involved, as well as the changing nature of our Air Force. 400,000 first printing. BOMC Main.</p><p>This Tom Clancy real-life military thriller is more nuanced than his novels, because its object is not simply to dramatize armed conflict but to relate the life lessons of his source, jet-pilot-turned-Desert-Storm-air-commander General Chuck Horner. Horner is no war cheerleader like General "Buck" Turgidson in <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>. He loathes the arrogance of the backwards, nuke-happy Strategic Air Command and the madly out-of-touch Vietnam War planner Robert McNamara. McNamara confesses his folly in two books, <i>Argument Without End</i> and <i>In Retrospect</i>, but Horner's you-are-there account more vividly demonstrates Vietnam's grim lessons. He flew an F-105 Thunderbird "Thud" fighter in the Wild Weasels, the unit with the highest medals-per-aircrew ratio, knew pilots who were stoned to death by villagers, and realized all the bombing did zero good. "All we really had to do was befriend Ho," says Horner sensibly. "Seems he wasn't part of a monolithic Communist plot, and hated the Chinese more than anything else." Horner is savvy about the screwups, the achievements, and the political maneuvering in and after the Gulf War, as leaders and branches of service battled for PR victories. His idea of a hero is Boomer McBroom's pilot Captain Gentner Drummond, who won a Flying Cross medal for refusing AWACS orders to down a jet that turned out to be a Saudi ally. Horner thinks the interservice and international cooperation in the Gulf War was way better than in Vietnam, but there's ample room for improvement. The action scenes aren't quite as brilliant as those in <i>Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War</i>, but Clancy fans will find plenty to admire. Horner's improbable survival of a 150-m.p.h. near-crash in Libya in 1962 belongs in a Tom Clancy film. <i>--Tim Appelo</i><p> Tom Clancy was the author of eighteen #1 <i>New York Times-</i>bestselling novels. His first effort, <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>, sold briskly as a result of rave reviews, then catapulted onto the bestseller list after President Ronald Reagan pronounced it the perfect yarn. Clancy was the undisputed master at blending exceptional realism and authenticity, intricate plotting, and razor-sharp suspense. He died in October 2013.</p> <p> </p></p><h2>The Oxford Guide to Heraldry</h2><p>Beautifully illustrated with 32 full-color plates and over one hundred halftones and line drawings, <em>The Oxford Guide to Heraldry</em> offers a fascinating tour of the heart of medieval pagentry. The first guide to heraldry written by Officers of Arms with full access to the College of Arms Library--which boasts the finest collection of heraldic manuscripts in the world--this colorful volume is both an authoritative, completely up-to-date reference for experts and an excellent introduction for beginners, covering the origins of heraldry, the composition of arms and their visual appearance, the use of arms as decoration, and much more. <br> The authors explain how coats of arms differed from country to country, with informative sections on France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and other European nations, plus a complete chapter devoted to heraldry in America. They discuss the traditional tinctures (colors) used--two metals, five colors, and two furs--and reveal that the colors are continually updated (for instance, after World War II, the color Bleu Celeste was added to honor the Royal Air Force). The book also outlines the virtues associated with the colors (red or "gules" signified magnanimity, black or "sable" prudence), the types of shield division (such as pale, fess, bend sinister, and chevron), the symbolism of animals (the owl signified a lazy man, the bear a strong but unwise warrior), and countless other aspects of this ancient art. This encyclopedic resource also includes an appendix on the Royal Arms of Great Britain, a glossary of heraldic terms, and a list of English and Scottish Kings of Arms. <br> Heraldry is many things: a fascinating art, a system of symbols denoting prominent families and institutions, a beautiful display of pageantry, an important part of the historical record. The most authoritative guide to heraldry available, this lavishly illustrated volume is an invaluable reference for anyone interested in genealogy, history, chivalry, or the decorative arts.</p><p><br><em>About the Authors</em>:<br> <br> <strong>Thomas Woodcock</strong> is the Somerset Herald. <strong>John Martin Robinson</strong> is Fitzalan Pursuivant Extraordinary and the author of <em>The Dukes of Norfolk</em>.<br></p><h2>Conceptual Astronomy</h2><p>Uses an innovative, imaginative approach to the subject, stressing scientific model making.

The plane slammed onto the runway and burst into a vast fireball. The rescuers didn't move at first: nobody could possibly survive that crash. And then people began emerging from the summer corn that lined the runways. Miraculously, 184 of 296 passengers lived. <p>No one has ever attempted the complete reconstruction of a crash of this magnitude. Drawing on interviews with hundreds of survivors, crew, and airport and rescue personnel, Laurence Gonzales, a commercial pilot himself, captures, minute by minute, the harrowing journey of pilots flying a plane with no controls and flight attendants keeping their calm in the face of certain death. He plumbs the hearts and minds of passengers as they pray, bargain with God, plot their strategies for survival, and sacrifice themselves to save others.</p><p>Ultimately he takes us, step by step, through the gripping scientific detective work in super-secret labs to dive into the heart of a flaw smaller than a grain of rice that shows what brought the aircraft down.</p><p>An unforgettable drama of the triumph of heroism over tragedy and human ingenuity over technological breakdown, <em>Flight 232</em> is a masterpiece in the tradition of the greatest aviation stories ever told.</p> 8 pages of illiustrations</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, July 2014:</strong> Twenty five years ago this month, a United Airlines flight from Denver to Chicago burst into a fireball and crashed in a cornfield outside of Sioux City, Iowa. It was one of the worst plane disasters in history--but it could have been worse. Of the 296 people on board, 184 survived. In his very long and gripping <em>Flight 232: A Story of Disaster and Survival</em>, journalist Laurence Gonzales takes us through the moments before and after the crash (as best remembered by those survivors and observers on the ground). He also goes back through records, scientific documents, and his own experience as a pilot and aviation reporter to piece together what went wrong with the jetliner that was as majestic (and, ultimately, doomed) as the Titanic. (The last third of the narrative delves into the tiny, microscopic flaw that likely brought the plane down.) As you might expect, there was plenty of terror on Flight 232, but what is surprising is how much inspiring behavior Gonzales discovered there as well--flight attendants who truly did put the passengers&#x2019; needs first, crew members whose quick thinking probably made the crash less devastating than it would have been, not to mention the plain dumb luck in evidence, as well--at least one woman moved out of first class at the last minute. Her original seat was eviscerated; she survived. This is a hard book to read because it addresses some of our worst fears and some we&#x2019;d never even thought of (apparently, the blue water in the toilets on planes can leak out, freeze and get stuck, as ice, to the outside of the plane). But it is also a story of survival, a tale of science, of heroism and of faith. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Laurence Gonzales is the author of Surviving Survival, Flight 232, and the bestseller Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why.

The Martins' disappearance spurred the largest missing persons search in Oregon history and the mystery has remained perplexingly unsolved to this day. For the past six years, JB Fisher (<i>Portland on the Take</i>) has pored over the case after finding in his garage a stack of old <i>Oregon Journal</i> newspaper articles about the story. Through a series of serendipitous encounters, Fisher obtained a wealth of first-hand and never-before publicized information about the case including police reports from several agencies, materials and photos belonging to the Martin family, and the personal notebooks and papers of Multnomah County Sheriff's Detective Walter E. Graven, who was always convinced the case was a homicide and worked tirelessly to prove it. Graven, however, faced real resistance from his superiors to bring his findings to light. Used as a trail left behind after his 1988 death to guide future researchers, Graven's personal documents provide fascinating insight into the question of what happened to the Martins&#x2014;a path leading to abduction and murder, an intimate family secret, and civic corruption going all the way to the Kennedys in Washington, DC.</p><p><b>JB Fisher</b>&nbsp;teaches writing at Portland Community College.

Now, with this book in hand, counselors and therapists can help the recovering alcoholic or addict develop skills to manage anger and avoid outbursts of aggression or violence. Intended primarily for counselors working with alcoholics, addicts, and their families in chemical dependency treatment settings, clinics, or private practice, as well as for those treating family violence, this book elucidates the complex relationships among anger, aggression, and chemical abuse. Early chapters present models of normal anger, anger avoidance, and chronic anger. The authors describe how both anger avoidance and chronic anger are related to chemical use patterns, the effects upon family members, and how change can be initiated. A brief device for assessing chronic anger and its functions is included. General principles for treating anger problems, as well as specific applications of these principles in a chemical dependency treatment, are presented. Special attention is given to the challenges of anger management with the chronically angry. In addition, selected aspects of anger and aggression, including explosiveness, anger-inducing thought patterns, and long-term resentments, are covered. Anger and aggression reverberate within the family and immediate environment. Strategies are included here for helping affected family members live with an angry (and perhaps addicted) person, for working with angry couples, and for treatment of adult children from homesdominated by anger and addiction. The authors also address the need to treat self-directed and self-destructive anger. Finally, they look at professional anger issues, since many counselors have problems with excessive anger or anger avoidance, in both their professional and their personal lives. Each chapter includes numerous exercises to address anger with chemically dependent clients. Throughout the book case studies illustrate both problems and solutions. Highly focused and practical, this book will be invaluable to any therapist who has ever faced an angry client.</p><h2>Full-Color Floral Designs in the Art Nouveau Style</h2><p>New York, NY Dover Publications 1977 Trade paperback Fry, Charles R Trade paperback (US).

Each chapter covers a major school of contemporary political thought--utilitarianism, liberal egalitarianism, libertarianism, Marxism, communitarianism, and feminism--while discussing the work of the most influential contemporary Anglo-American theorists, including G. A. Cohen, Ronald Dworkin, Carol Gilligan, R.M. Hare, Catherine Mackinnon, Robert Nozick, John Rawls, John Roemer, Michael Sandel, and Charles Taylor. By showing how each of these thinkers interprets the idea of treating people as equals, Kymlicka highlights the key similarities and differences in their modes of thought. He demonstrates how viewing different theories in terms of this &#34;egalitarian plateau&#34; can help to clarify traditional philosophical disputes over the meaning of such concepts as rights, freedom, the common good, exploitation, and justice. Written in a lively, non-technical style that is accessible to students approaching the subject for the first time, this book will be useful and important reading in a wide variety of courses in political science, philosophy, and legal studies.</p><p><br>Will Kymlicka is Professor of Philosophy at Queens University, Canada<br>`Review of second edition: <br> <br>'There is an effortless command of a range of arguments and theories, comprehensive and informed knowledge of the relevant sources, and a narrative which is highly accessible and at the same time organises the material intelligently. Kymlicka's own views are expressed but in a way that does not do<br>a disservice to those he criticises. This is a fine example of an introductory text which does not mute its authors stance but which benefits from his partisan participation in the debates'' <br>Dr David Archard, University of St Andrews<br><br>`Review of second edition: <br> <br>'Kymlicka has an exceptional ability to present difficult material in an accessible manner that nevertheless allows the reader to understand why the issue is complex and why it matters. The chapters are clearly written, pitched at the right level, and cover the territory'' <br>Dr Matt Matravers, University of York<br><br>Review of second edition: <br> <br>'(The) changes make this edition sill more attractive and useful than the first. Its depth, lucidity and rigour mark it out as one of the better introductions on the market for anyone who wishes seriously to engage with the important recent debates within contemporary liberal theory. It stands out<br>as that rare introductory book that offers the hard analytical work required if one is really to get to grips with the issues.' THES<br><br>`Review of first edition: <br> <br>'Kymlicka has given us a superb book that might serve as a central text in both introductory and advanced courses in political philosophy...Kymlicka's striking achievement is to have presented a sophisticated philosophical analysis in clear, non-technical language readily intellible to any<br>alternative reader...'' <br>David Stern, Teaching Philosophy<br><br>`Review of first edition: <br> <br>`... For a higher-level undergraduate or graduate course on contemporary political philosophy it would be ideal. Moreover, it is a serious work in political philosophy deserving the attention and respect of the mature political-philosophical community'' <br>James Child, Philosophical Quarterly</p><h2>Sovereign Virtue: The Theory and Practice of Equality</h2><p><p> Equality is the endangered species of political ideals. Even left-of-center politicians reject equality as an ideal: government must combat poverty, they say, but need not strive that its citizens be equal in any dimension. In his new book Ronald Dworkin insists, to the contrary, that equality is the indispensable virtue of democratic sovereignty. A legitimate government must treat all its citizens as equals, that is, with equal respect and concern, and, since the economic distribution that any society achieves is mainly the consequence of its system of law and policy, that requirement imposes serious egalitarian constraints on that distribution. </p><p> What distribution of a nation's wealth is demanded by equal concern for all? Dworkin draws upon two fundamental humanist principles--first, it is of equal objective importance that all human lives flourish, and second, each person is responsible for defining and achieving the flourishing of his or her own life--to ground his well-known thesis that true equality means equality in the value of the resources that each person commands, not in the success he or she achieves. Equality, freedom, and individual responsibility are therefore not in conflict, but flow from and into one another as facets of the same humanist conception of life and politics. Since no abstract political theory can be understood except in the context of actual and complex political issues, Dworkin develops his thesis by applying it to heated contemporary controversies about the distribution of health care, unemployment benefits, campaign finance reform, affirmative action, assisted suicide, and genetic engineering. </p></p><p><b>Ronald Dworkin</b> is Sommer Professor of Law and Philosophy at New York University and Jeremy Bentham Professor of Jurisprudence at University College London. He is the 2007 recipient of the Holberg International Memorial Prize.<p> From the book: </p><p> "Politicians are now anxious to endorse what they call a 'new' liberalism, or a 'third' way between the old rigidities of right and left. These descriptions are often criticized as merely slogans lacking substance. The criticism is generally justified, but the appeal of the slogans nevertheless suggests something important. The old egalitarians insisted that a political community has a collective responsibility to show equal concern for all its citizens, but they defined that equal concern in a way that ignored those citizens' personal responsibilities. Conservatives--new and old--insisted on that personal responsibility, but they have defined it so as to ignore the collective responsibility. The choice between these two mistakes is an unnecessary as well as an unattractive one. If the argument that follows is sound, we can achieve a unified account of equality and responsibility that respects both. If that is the third way then it should be our way." </p></p><h2>Mastering Spanish Vocabulary: A Thematic Approach (Mastering Vocabulary) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>This Spanish word-power builder presents more than 5,000 words and phrases with translations into English.

By this we don&#x2019;t mean that children should be able to read any book in the library or write a perfectly polished essay; rather, they should be able to read books appropriate to beginning readers, and write legibly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing is more important in a child&#x2019;s schooling than learning to read and write confidently by the end of first grade or more important than extending that ability by the end of second grade.<br> &nbsp;<br> Based on authoritative advice from mainstream scientific research, the Core Knowledge Foundation has compiled a description of reading and writing goals that a school should work to achieve with all students in second grade. Those goals are included in the Core Knowledge Sequence, the curriculum guidelines upon which this book is based, and in the Core Knowledge Language Arts Program used in schools across the country.

The poetry includes traditional rhymes as well as a few favorites by modern writers. We encourage you to read many more poems with your child, to delight in the play of language, and occasionally to encourage your child to memorize a favorite poem.<br> &nbsp;<br> The stories presented here are mostly traditional tales that have stood the test of time. Some of the selections from other lands may not be familiar to American readers, but by including them here we hope to make them so. Parents and teachers may want to connect the folktales we include from China, Japan, and India with the introductions to those lands in the World History and Geography section of this book. We also offer a selection of Greek myths, which you can tie in with the discussion of ancient Greece in the World History and Geography section.<br> &nbsp;<br> The stories here are meant to complement, not replace, stories with controlled vocabularies and syntax that children may be given in school as part of their instruction in reading. While some second graders may be able to read the stories in this book on their own, those who find the language too complex can readily understand and enjoy these stories when they are read aloud and talked about with an adult. You may also want to try some &#x201c;shared reading,&#x201d; in which you read aloud parts of a story and your child reads aloud parts to you.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many of these stories convey traditional values such as honesty, courage, generosity, and diligence. Those parents who hope that schooling will instill ethical values can feel somewhat reassured if their children are being taught good literature. Next to human role models who exemplify the desired virtues, good literature is one of the best means of instilling ethical values. Plato said that stories are the most important part of early education and advised parents and teachers to take great care in choosing the right stories: &#x201c;Let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mold the body.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We offer the stories in this book as a good starting point, and we encourage you and your child to explore further. Your local library has a treasury of good books, fiction and nonfiction.

This fascinating and original book breaks new ground in the area of Renaissance material culture, focusing on the marketplace and such related topics as middle-class to courtly consumption, the provision of foodstuffs, and the acquisition of antiquities and holy relics. The book investigates how men and women of different social classes went to the streets, squares, and shops to buy goods they needed and wanted on a daily&#x2014;or a once-in-a-lifetime&#x2014;basis, during the Renaissance period. </p> <p>Evelyn Welch draws on wide-ranging sources to expose the fears, anxieties, and social possibilities of the Renaissance marketplace and to show the impact of these attitudes on developing urban spaces. She considers transient forms of sales such as fairs, auctions, and lotteries as well as consumers themselves. Finally, she explores antiquities and indulgences, both of which posed dramatic challenges to contemporary notions of market value and to the concept of commodification itself.</p></p><p><p><b>Evelyn Welch</b> is professor of Renaissance studies, Queen Mary, University of London, and was formerly reader in the history of art, University of Sussex.

It is 1905, and Jeb Winslow, an adopted member of the family, travels to Montana to visit a ranch run by his relations, the Rogers family. Jeb is enthralled with their daughter Annie, who hopes to become a missionary in Africa. Jeb, meanwhile, wants to become a hunter in Africa. Both pursue their dreams, with Annie's goals taking her to New York City and onto the Titanic before she is eventually reunited with her true love, Jeb.

Most students are members of the Grand Secretariat of the Hanlin Academy, the body of top-ranking graduates of the civil service examination who serve as advisers to the Wanli emperor. Some Grand Secretaries are Confucian &#x201c;purists,&#x201d; who hold that tradition obliges the emperor to name his first-born son as successor; others, in support of the most senior of the Grand Secretaries, maintain that it is within the emperor&#x2019;s right to choose his successor; and still others, as they decide this matter among many issues confronting the empire, continue to scrutinize the teachings of Confucianism for guidance. The game unfolds amidst the secrecy and intrigue within the walls of the Forbidden City, as scholars struggle to apply Confucian precepts to a dynasty in peril.<br><br><p><em>Reacting to the Past</em> is a series of historical role-playing games that explore important ideas by re-creating the contexts that shaped them.

Marieb</b>, taking the student&#x2019;s perspective into account has always been an integral part of her teaching style. Dr. Marieb began her teaching career at Springfield College, where she taught anatomy and physiology to physical education majors. She then joined the faculty of the Biological Science Division of Holyoke Community College in 1969 after receiving her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. While teaching at Holyoke Community College, where many of her students were pursuing nursing degrees, she developed a desire to better understand the relationship between the scientific study of the human body and the clinical aspects of the nursing practice. To that end, while continuing to teach full time, Dr. Marieb pursued her nursing education, which culminated in a Master of Science degree with a clinical specialization in gerontology from the University of Massachusetts. It is this experience that has informed the development of the unique perspective and accessibility for which her publications are known.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Marieb has partnered with Benjamin Cummings for over 30 years. Her first work was Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology Laboratory Manual (Cat Version), which came out in 1981. In the years since, several other lab manual versions and study guides, as well as the softcover Essentials of Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology textbook, have hit the campus bookstores. This textbook, now in its 10th edition, made its appearance in 1989 and is the latest expression of her commitment to the needs of students studying human anatomy and physiology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Marieb has given generously to colleges both near and far to provide opportunities for students to further their education. She contributes to the New Directions, New Careers Program at Holyoke Community College by funding a staffed drop-in center and by providing several full-tuition scholarships each year for women who are returning to college after a hiatus or attending college for the first time and who would be unable to continue their studies without financial support. She funds the E. N. Marieb Science Research Awards at Mount Holyoke College, which promotes research by undergraduate science majors, and has underwritten renovation and updating of one of the biology labs in Clapp Laboratory at that college. Dr. Marieb also contributes to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where she generously provided funding for reconstruction and instrumentation of a cutting-edge cytology research laboratory. Recognizing the severe national shortage of nursing faculty, she underwrites the Nursing Scholars of the Future Grant Program at the university. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1994, Dr. Marieb received the Benefactor Award from the National Council for Resource Development, American Association of Community Colleges, which recognizes her ongoing sponsorship of student scholarships, faculty teaching awards, and other academic contributions to Holyoke Community College. In May 2000, the science building at Holyoke Community College was named in her honor. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Marieb is an active member of the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Additionally, while actively engaged as an author, Dr. Marieb serves as a consultant for the Benjamin Cummings Interactive Physiology� CD-ROM series. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When not involved in academic pursuits, Dr. Marieb is a world traveler and has vowed to visit every country on this planet. Shorter term, she serves on the scholarship committee of the Women&#x2019;s Resources Center and on the board of directors of several charitable institutions in Sarasota County. She is an enthusiastic supporter of the local arts and enjoys a competitive match of doubles tennis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Dr. Katja Hoehn </b>is a professor in the Department of Biology at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Canada. Dr. Hoehn&#x2019;s first love is teaching. Her teaching excellence has been recognized by several awards during her 20 years at Mount Royal University. These include a PanCanadian Educational Technology Faculty Award (1999), a Teaching Excellence Award from the Students&#x2019; Association of Mount Royal (2001), and the Mount Royal Distinguished Faculty Teaching Award (2004).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Hoehn received her M.D. (with Distinction) from the University of Saskatchewan, and her Ph.D. in Pharmacology from Dalhousie University. In 1991, the Dalhousie Medical Research Foundation presented her with the Max Forman (Jr.) Prize for excellence in medical research. During her Ph.D. and postdoctoral studies, she also pursued her passion for teaching by presenting guest lectures to first- and second-year medical students at Dalhousie University and at the University of Calgary.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Hoehn has been a contributor to several books and has written numerous research papers in Neuroscience and Pharmacology. She oversaw a recent revision of the Benjamin Cummings Interactive Physiology� CD-ROM series modules, and coauthored the newest module, The Immune System. Following Dr. Marieb&#x2019;s example, Dr. Hoehn provides financial support for students in the form of a scholarship that she established in 2006 for nursing students at Mount Royal University.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Hoehn is also actively involved in the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS) and is a member of the American Association of Anatomists. When not teaching, she likes to spend time outdoors with her husband and two sons, compete in triathlons, and play Irish flute.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Medical Imaging</h2><p>This third edition provides a concise and generously illustrated survey of the complete field of medical imaging and image computing, explaining the mathematical and physical principles and giving the reader a clear understanding of how images are obtained and interpreted.

By employing a comparative analysis across a rich range of ancient and modern religious traditions, this introduction allows readers to see the ways in which certain classic forms of religious life appear in different societies over time, as well as to recognize the incredible diversity of human religious expression and belief. <b> </b> Divided into three parts, Part I covers the problem of defining religion; the importance of the study of religion; and the methods used in the study of religion. Part II covers the sacred and holy; religious symbolism; myth, and doctrine; sacared ritual; sacred scripture; and the social dimensions of religion. Part III includes analyses of concepts such as deity; cosmogony; the human problem; theodicy, ethics; the ways to salvation or liberation; and the end or goal of salvation. <b> </b> For those interested in examining aspects of the comparative and theoretical study of religion. </p></p><p><p> Jim Livingston's <i>Anatomy of the Sacred: An Introduction to Religion</i> is a comprehensive introduction to the nature and variety of religious belief and practice. The text explores the issues inherent in the study of religion, examines the universal forms of religious experience, offers a crosscultural study of a broad range of classic types of religious belief and practice in terms of the seven basic concepts of a religious world view, and surveys the challenges faced by religions today. </p> <b>New to the Fifth Edition:</b> <ul> <li>Entirely new chapter on the response of religion to Modernity, drawing examples from Islamic and American Protestant Fundamentalism</li> <li>Extensive discussion of gender and the role of women, using examples largely from Roman Catholicism and Islam</li> <li>A new discussion of recent New Age religious movements</li> <li>More illustrative material from contemporary religious life, including an expanded discussion of science and religion</li> <li>Pedagogy, including Key Words, Review Questions, and Suggestions for Further Reading have been revised and updated.</li> </ul><p> <i>Anatomy of the Sacred</i> is a comprehensive introduction to the nature and variety of religious belief and practice. Designed primarily for those who have not had a previous course in religion, it provides the student with an understanding of what religion is, of the universal forms of religious experience, and of the basic concepts that make up a religious worldview. By employing a comparative analysis across a rich range of ancient and modern religious traditions, this introduction allows students to see the ways in which certain classic forms of religious life appear in different societies over time, as well as to recognize the incredible diversity of human religious expression and belief. </p> <p> The book is divided into four parts. Part I is concerned with such questions as the problem of defining religion, why it is important to study religion, and how one goes about the task, including the several disciplines or methods used in the study of religion. Each method is illustrated with specific examples from the work of eminent scholars in the field. </p> <p> Part II is an introduction to the universal forms of religious experience and expression and includes discussions of the sacred and holy; religious symbolism, myth, and doctrine; sacred ritual; sacred scripture; and the social dimensions of religion. </p> <p> Part III, which constitutes more than half of the book, consists of a comparative analysis of seven concepts, each one representing a fundamental structure or component of a religious worldview. A religious worldview is holistic, that is, it sees nature, human life, and the divine as interrelated and as forming a comprehensive vision of the world. A religion, therefore, includes a conception of sacred power and of an exemplary natural and social order. It offers an analysis of the breakdown or corruption of that order and of the human problem, but it also provides an answer to the ever-present threat of evil and chaos. Finally, a religious worldview affords an ethical pattern of action, a way of achieving liberation or enlightenment, and an ideal vision of the goal or end of human life. Part III thus includes analyses of such concepts as deity, cosmogony, the human problem, theodicy, ethics, the ways to salvation or liberation, and the end or goal of salvation. Again, each theme is illustrated by examples drawn from a wide variety of religious belief and behavior, ranging from primal and archaic cultures through the religions of the present. </p> <p> Part IV addresses the question, What impact has Modernity, that is, the immense changes that have occurred in our social, political, legal, and economic institutions, as well as the wider access to education, the influence of science, technology, and mass communications, had on religious life and institutions today? It then examines the secularization thesis and raises questions about its validity. Finally, it explores contemporary religious Fundamentalism and the changing roles of women in religion and society as two different responses to these modern challenges facing religion today and in the future. </p> <p> In preparing a new edition of this book I am especially aware of my debt to those teachers who were asked to evaluate the fourth edition and who offered excellent advice. I am, of course, also in the debt of many scholars whose highly specialized studies I was required to consult in updating substantive discussions in the text as well as the notes and suggestions for further reading. The important additions and revisions incorporated in this edition include an entirely new chapter on the response of religion to modernity; an extensive new discussion of the changing roles of women in religion; a new, substantive discussion of New Age religious movements and their significance; more illustrative material from contemporary religious life (e.g., an extended discussion of science and religion), and an extensive updating of the review questions and the suggestions for further reading. I would also like to thank the following reviewers: Linda J. Tessier, Youngstown State University; Scott Jansen, Chaffey College; Steven W. Godby, Broward Community College; Clark M. Brittain, Greenville Technical College; and Winston Davis, Washington and Lee University. </p> <p> In preparing this edition I am particularly indebted to three individuals for their expert assistance: Tammy Cooper, secretary for the Department of Religion at the College of William and Mary, who kindly assisted with the preparation of early drafts; my wife Jackie, who, as always, has given me invaluable help as a copy editor; and my daughter Susannah, a professional editor, who assisted me in the final process of preparing the text. Her time and expertise were indispensable. I also thank Wendy Yurash, assistant editor at Prentice Hall, for her valuable assistance and her patience over many months, and Karen L. Berry for her excellent work and help. I am delighted to' dedicate this edition to my grandchildren: Max, Peter, Maria, and James, young students on their way. </p> <p> <i>J. C.

Starting from the view that it is rational always to choose what will give one the greatest expectation of value or utility--and the common counter-claim that this procedure, applied in many situations, will actually leave people worse off than need be--Gauthier instead proposes a principle of cooperation whereby each must choose in accordance with a principle to which all can agree. He shows that not only does such a principle ensure mutual benefit and fairness, but also that each person may expect greater utility from actually adhering to a morality based on it, even though his other choice did not have that specific end primarily in view. In resolving what may appear to be a paradox, he establishes morals on the foundation of reason.<br></p><p>In this book the author argues that moral principles are principles of rational choice. According to the usual view of choice, a rational person selects what is likely to give the greatest expectation of value or utility.David Gauthier is at University of Pittsburgh.</p><h2>Administrative Law: Cases and Materials (Aspen Casebook Series)</h2><p><p><strong>Administrative Law</strong> integrates doctrinal analysis and procedural rules with substantive policy areas to encourage students to see the relevance of administrative law in policy and contemporary politics.

Daniel P. Todes fundamentally reinterprets the Russian physiologist's famous research on conditional reflexes and weaves his life, values, and science into the tumultuous century of Russian history-particularly that of its intelligentsia-from the reign of tsar Nicholas I to Stalin's time. <br><br>Ivan Pavlov was born to a family of priests in provincial Riazan before the serfs were emancipated, and made his home and professional success in the booming capital of St. Petersburg in late imperial Russia. He suffered the cataclysmic destruction of his world during the Bolshevik seizure of power and civil war of 1917-21, rebuilt his life in his seventies as a "prosperous dissident" during the Leninist 1920s, and flourished professionally as never before in the 1930s industrialization, revolution, and terror of Stalin times.<br><br>Using a wide variety of previously unavailable archival materials, Todes tells a vivid story of that life and redefines Pavlov's legacy. Pavlov was not, in fact, a behaviorist who believed that psychology should address only external behaviors; rather, he sought to explain the emotional and intellectual life of animals and humans, "the torments of our consciousness." This iconic "objectivist" was actually a profoundly anthropomorphic thinker whose science was suffused with his own experiences, values, and subjective interpretations.<br><br>Todes's story of this powerful personality and extraordinary man is based upon interviews with surviving coworkers and family members (along with never-before-analyzed taped interviews from the 1960s and 1970s), examination of hundreds of scientific works by Pavlov and his coworkers, and close analysis of materials from some twenty-five archives. The materials range from the records of his student years at Riazan Seminary to the transcripts of the Communist Party cells in his labs, and from his scientific manuscripts and notebooks to his political speeches; they include revealing love letters to his future wife and correspondence with hundreds of scholars, artists, and Communist Party leaders; and memoirs by many coworkers, his daughter, his wife, and his lover.<br><br>The product of more than twenty years of research, this is the first scholarly biography of the physiologist to be published in any language.<br></p><p><br><strong>Daniel P.

So speaks the haunted former boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) to his brother Charley (Rod Steiger) in a scene from <i>On the Waterfront</i> (Elia Kazan, 1954) that is one of the most famous in all cinema. Set among unionised New York longshoremen, Kazan's film (from a screenplay by Budd Schulberg) recounts Terry's struggle against corruption and his ultimate, hard-won victory. The marvellous performances of Brando, Steiger and Eva Marie Saint (as well as Karl Malden and Lee J. Cobb), Boris Kaufman's photography and Leonard Bernstein's score all justify the film's fame. But On the Waterfront is also notorious, regarded by many as an attempt at justifying the decision on the part of Kazan (and Schulberg) to name names before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. That controversial decision is still incendiary today (as was evidenced in the furore that surrounded Kazan's Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1999). With Kazan's death in 2003 and Brando's in 2004, a reappraisalof On the Waterfront is timely and necessary. In this definitive study, Leo Braudy tells the complicated story of the film's production. He revisits the facts behind the controversy of Kazan's testimony but, above all, he analyses the elements which contribute to the enduring appeal of <i>On the Waterfront</i>: the Method-inspired acting, the music and cinematography, the use of authentic locations and its powerfully symbolic depiction of post-war American values.</p><p>Leo Braudy is University Professor and Bing Professor of English at the University of Southern California.

A comprehensive and comparative history of words with analyses of their underlying neglected genealogies and structures of signification&#x2014;and this via a masterful journey through Germanic, Romance, Indo-Iranian, Latin, and Greek languages&#x2014;Benveniste&#x2019;s dictionary is a must-read for anthropologists, linguists, literary theorists, classicists, and philosophers alike.<br> <br> This book has famously inspired a wealth of thinkers, including Roland Barthes, Claude L�vi-Strauss, Pierre Bourdieu, Jacques Derrida, Umberto Eco, Giorgio Agamben, Fran�ois Jullien, and many others. In this new volume, Benveniste&#x2019;s masterpiece on the study of language and society finds new life for a new generation of scholars. As political fictions continue to separate and reify differences between European, Middle Eastern, and South Asian societies, Benveniste reminds us just how historically deep their interconnections are and that understanding the way our institutions are evoked through the words that describe them is more necessary than ever.<br> </p></p><p><b>�mile Benveniste</b> (1902&#x2013;1976) was a French linguist and semiotician and professor of linguistics at the Coll�ge de France until 1969. He is the author of many works on Indo-European languages, including <i>Problems in General Linguistics</i>. Along with Claude L�vi-Strauss and Pierre Gourou, Benveniste was also cofounder of the anthropological journal <i>L&#x2019;Homme</i>.<br> &nbsp;"A great book, an indispensable book: une promesse de bonheur ('a promise of happiness') as Stendhal would have said, for any reader curious to explore the intricacies and depths of the language she or he speaks." (Carlo Ginzburg, author of&nbsp;The Cheese and the Worms)<br><br>"Benveniste&#x2019;s erudition impresses and enthralls: every entry in this monumental work of learning is revelatory of unsuspected origins and connections among languages, cultures, and worlds of thought. A fundamental work not only of reference but also of inspiration for all scholars and all readers who love the web of words." (Lorraine Datson, author of&nbsp;Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150&#x2013;1750)<br><br>"This masterpiece of the human sciences of the twentieth century is crossed by a genuinely poetic impulse. Indo-European institutions do not appear so much as 'states' or as 'substances' but as living relationships in motion in the minds of men who think and speak. . . . This is why, by setting itself apart from works that are only similar in appearance, Benveniste&#x2019;s Dictionary remains a totally unique work, which no inquiry in the humanities could do without."

The manual is your invitation to participate in a learner-centered laboratory, an environment that allows you to make first-hand discoveries about invertebrates. The manual is your guide through your studies, asking you to see the organisms in new ways. The manual does not tell you all that there is to see and know, nor does it give you the quick answer. To paraphrase George Perkins Marsh, in this manual it is our aim to stimulate thought and observation, but not satisfy curiosity, and it is no part of our purpose to save the student from the labor of thought. The cover photograph of the jellyfish shown, is symbolic of this pedagogy; while the jellyfish is transparent, the invertebrate must be studied to glean it's secrets. </p><p> Invertebrate zoology is an enormous field. About 96% of all animal species lack backbones, but this assessment may be too conservative. Recent estimates suggest that 10 million insect species in the Amazonian forests have yet to be described. If this prediction is true, the numerical dominance of invertebrate species will be approximately 99%. Nevertheless, humans seem preoccupied with organisms possessing vertebral columns, especially if an animal resembles, in any way, one of those cuddly toys made for young children. Invertebrates, on the other hand, are often viewed with disgust, evoking unwarranted fears and horrific screams of terror when encountered in a disused corner of a basement, in a half-eaten apple, or crawling on one's body. We do not mean to imply that invertebrates do not cause human suffering or seriously damage agricultural products. They do, and it is for these, reasons and because as a group the invertebrates possess such diverse and rich biologies that they are worthy of intensive study. </p></p><h2>Curiositree Natural World</h2><p>Curiositree: Natural World<br>A first introduction to the natural world that looks at the myriad ways in which plants and animals have adapted to give themselves the best chance of survival.

While some elements of the elegant design and illustrations are a bit retro, the volume contains a wealth of up-to-date information and facts about habitats and species. Each chartlike page displays some aspect of nature, from the many varieties of feathers or leaf shapes to the ecosystems of the Arctic and rain forest. The slipcover folds out into a wall poster of birds, insects, and migrators, and three colors of ribbon bookmarks emerge from the binding to facilitate navigation. Color-coded arrows visually refer readers to other pages on related subjects. The digitally created illustrations resemble traditional media with a subtle, sophisticated palette, adding to the symbiosis of old and new design techniques.

Braddock, Max Baer, And The Greatest Upset In Boxing History</h2><p>Offers a portrait of an American icon, boxer James J. Braddock, who staged a remarkable comeback during the Depression that captured the imagination of millions of working-class Americans.</p><p>Includes a one-hour interview from 1970 with boxing legend James Braddock! <br>Lost in the annals of boxing is the sport's true Cinderella story. James J. Braddock, dubbed "Cinderella Man" by Damon Runyon, was a once promising light heavyweight for whom a string of losses in the ring and a broken right hand happened to correspond with the Great Crash. With one good hand, Braddock was forced to labor on the docks of Hoboken. Only his manager, Joe Gould, still believed in him, finding fights for Braddock to help feed his wife and children. The diminutive, loquacious Jew and the burly, quiet Irishman made one of boxing's oddest couples, but together they staged the greatest comeback in boxing history. In less than twelve months Braddock went from the relief rolls to face heavyweight champion Max Baer, the Livermore Butcher Boy, renowned for having allegedly killed two men in the ring. A charismatic, natural talent and in every way Braddock's foil, Baer was a towering opponent, a Jew from the West Coast who was famously brash and made great copy both in and out of the ring. A ten-to-one underdog, Braddock carried the hopes and dreams of the working class on his shoulders. And when boxing was the biggest sport in the world, when the heavyweight champion was the biggest star in the world, his unlikely upset made him the most popular champion boxing had ever seen. <br>Against the gritty backdrop of the Depression, Cinderella Man brings this dramatic all-American story to life, evoking a time when the sport of boxing resonated with a country trying desperately to get back on its feet. Rich in anecdote and color, steeped in history, and full of human interest, Cinderella Man is a classic Davidand Goliath tale that transcends the sport. <p>"From the Compact Disc edition.</p>Jeremy Schaap is the author of the New York Times bestseller Cinderella Man.

Its sequel, <i>Return to Peyton Place</i>, published in 1959, was a national best-seller for many, many months. Considered scandalous it its time of publication, <i>Peyton Place</i>, stirred controversy with its explicit&#x2014;for the time&#x2014;depictions of sex and sins in a small New England town. Today, the once shocking novel and its sequel seem tame, and are taught in college English courses as classics of their time, well-written and honest in the evocation of the passions, jealousies, and secrets of small-town America.</p><p>Grace Metalious was born in a French-Canadian ghetto in New Hampshire in 1924. She wrote three other novels and died of cirrhosis of the liver at age 39.Heres an unexpected publication: a new edition, complete with scholarly introduction, of the 1956 succs de scandale that was in its time the single bestselling American novel, inspiring both a nighttime ``television novel'' (i.e., soap opera) and an only slightly less soapy (1958) feature film. Metalious (192464) was a competent writer with some flair whose punchy workmanlike prose efficiently captured her little inland New England hamlet's earthy (if somewhat unbelievably sexually functional) populace. The charactersamong others, Allison MacKenzie, round-heeled Betty Anderson, m.c.p. Rodney Harrington, and longsuffering Selena Crossretain a perversely appealing, pulpy vitality. But scholar Ardis Cameron's assertion that this likeably trashy novel offers a valuable corrective to the myth of quiescent domesticity and class consensus,'' besides gilding the lily indefensibly, confuses its author with Sinclair Lewis, not to mention Gustave Flaubert. Peyton Place is, on its own terms, both a perfectly decent popular novel and an honest one. But it never was an important one, and no amount of retroactive puffery can make it so. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In 1971, the year before Title IX was passed, fewer than 295,000 high school girls and 30,000 college women participated in their schools' athletic programs.

But to David Leeming, myths are more than stories of deities and fantastic beings from non-Christian cultures. Myth is at once the most particular and the most universal feature of civilization, representing common concerns that each society voices in its own idiom. Whether an Egyptian story of creation or the big-bang theory of modern physics, myth is metaphor, mirroring our deepest sense of ourselves in relation to existence itself.<br><br>Now, in <em>The World of Myth</em>, Leeming provides a sweeping anthology of myths, ranging from ancient Egypt and Greece to the Polynesian islands and modern science. We read stories of great floods from the ancient Babylonians, Hebrews, Chinese, and Mayans; tales of apocalypse from India, the Norse, Christianity, and modern science; myths of the mother goddess from Native American Hopi culture and James Lovelock's <em>Gaia</em>. Leeming has culled myths from Aztec, Greek, African, Australian Aboriginal, Japanese, Moslem, Hittite, Celtic, Chinese, and Persian cultures, offering one of the most wide-ranging collections of what he calls the collective dreams of humanity.<br><br>More important, he has organized these myths according to a number of themes, comparing and contrasting how various societies have addressed similar concerns, or have told similar stories. In the section on dying gods, for example, both Odin and Jesus sacrifice themselves to renew the world, each dying on a tree. Such traditions, he proposes, may have their roots in societies of the distant past, which would ritually sacrifice their kings to renew the tribe.<br><br>In <em>The World of Myth</em>, David Leeming takes us on a journey "not through a maze of falsehood but through a marvellous world of metaphor," metaphor for "the story of the relationship between the known and the unknown, both around us and within us." Fantastic, tragic, bizarre, sometimes funny, the myths he presents speak of the most fundamental human experience, a part of what Joseph Campbell called "the wonderful song of the soul's high adventure."</p><p><br><strong>David Adams Leeming</strong> is Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Connecticut, Storrs, and is the author of several books on myth and literature.<br>In Mythology: The Voyage of the Hero (Harper, 1980), Leeming collected over 100 hero myths for a comparative study. In his new volume the myths of various types are divided into four sections: of the cosmos, of the gods, of the hero, and of places and objects, within which subdivisions deal with "The Trickster," "The God as Archetype," "The Tree," etc. His introduction and pre-chapter commentaries are concise and somewhat probing.

Looking at how political ambition and domestic pressures impact foreign policymaking is the key to understanding how and why foreign policy decisions are made. The text begins by using this analytic approach to look at the history of foreign policymaking and then examines how various parties inside and outside government influence decision making. In a unique third section, the book takes a regional approach, not only covering trends other books tend to miss, but giving students the opportunity to think comprehensively about how issues intersect around the globe&#x2015;from human security and democratization, to globalization and pollution. Guided by input from adopters and reviewers, Ray has thoroughly re-organized the book and streamlined some coverage to better consolidate the historical, institutional, regional, and topical chapters and focus the thematic lens of the book. Ray has also brought the book fully up-to-date, addressing the latest events in American foreign policy, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the killing of Bin Laden, the WikiLeaks scandal and its aftermath, the impact of social media on foreign policy and world affairs, nuclear proliferation, developments in U.S.-Russian relations, climate change, and more.</p><p><p><b>James Ray</b> received his B.A. from Ohio State, and PhD from the University of Michigan. He has held positions at SUNY-Fredonia, the University of New Mexico, Florida State University, and is currently at Vanderbilt University. His research and writing have focused on international conflict, and most recently on the relationship of democracy to conflict. His introductory text on international relations has been published in 8 editions since 1979.</p></p><h2>The Nurse, The Math, The Meds: Drug Calculations Using Dimensional Analysis</h2><p><p>Use the simplicity of the dimensional analysis method to minimize drug calculation errors! <b>The Nurse, The Math, The Meds, 3rd Edition </b>helps you overcome any math anxiety you may have by clearly explaining how to use the dimensional analysis method.

Now, in this lucid and accessibly written book, Philip Ball applies state-of-the-art scientific understanding from the fields of biology, chemistry, geology, physics, and mathematics to these ancient mysteries, revealing how nature's seemingly complex patterns originate in simple physical laws.<br> Tracing the history of scientific thought about natural patterns, Ball shows how common presumptions--for example, that complex form must be guided by some intelligence or that form always follows function--are erroneous and continue to mislead scientists today. He investigates specific patterns in depth, revealing that these designs are self-organized and that simple, local interactions between component parts produce motifs like spots, stripes, branches, and honeycombs. In the process, he examines the mysterious phenomenon of symmetry and why it appears--and breaks--in similar ways in different systems. Finally, he attempts to answer this profound question: why are some patterns universal? Illustrations throughout the text, many in full color, beautifully illuminate Ball's ideas.<br></p><p>Seashells are often spirals, just like water going down the drain. There <i>must</i> be a connection, right? Our intuition scoffs at such a notion, but maybe they are related, writes <i>Nature</i> editor Philip Ball in <i>The Self-Made Tapestry: Pattern Formation in Nature</i>. This deep, beautiful exploration of the recurring patterns that we find both in the living and inanimate worlds will change how you think about everything from evolution to earthquakes. Not by any means a simple book, it is still completely engaging; even the occasional forays into mathematics and the abstractions of hydrodynamics are endurable, tucked as they are between Ball's bright prose and his hundreds of carefully selected illustrations.<p> When speaking of the living world, Ball seeks to go beyond the theory of natural selection, which explains <i>why</i> we see certain characteristics (height, shape, camouflage), to find mechanisms that can explain <i>how</i> such characteristics come to be. Again, this is no easy task, but for those willing to follow his discussion, the elegance of nature is laid out in zebras' stripes, ivy leaves, and butterfly wings. Moving on to find the same patterns at work in the clouds of Jupiter and the cracks in the San Andreas fault give strength to the feeling that there are self-composing structures that guide everything in the universe toward a kind of order. <i>The Self-Made Tapestry</i> is a challenging look at the biggest issues in science, and well worth a thorough read. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><br><strong>Philip Ball</strong>, an editor at <em>Nature</em> since 1988, has written many scientific articles on all topics for the popular press. His first book, <em>Designing the Molecular World</em>, won the American Association of Publishers award for books on chemistry.<br></p><h2>The Uses of the University: Fifth Edition (The Godkin Lectures on the Essentials of Free Government and the Duties of the Citizen)</h2><p><p>America's university president extraordinaire adds a new chapter and preface to <i>The Uses of the University</i>, probably the most important book on the modern university ever written. This summa on higher education brings the research university into the new century. </p><p>The multiversity that Clark Kerr so presciently discovered now finds itself in an age of apprehension with few certainties. Leaders of institutions of higher learning can be either hedgehogs or foxes in the new age. Kerr gives five general points of advice on what kinds of attitudes universities should adopt. He then gives a blueprint for action for foxes, suggesting that a few hedgehogs need to be around to protect university autonomy and the public weal.</p></p><p>Clark Kerr was President Emeritus and former Chancellor and Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

The research is based in large part on ethnographic fieldwork, which privileges the voices of the music-makers themselves, while interpreting their narratives through a richly textured mosaic of history and culture. The book is replete with references to seminal recordings and recording artists, musical transcriptions, photographs, and illustrations that bring the music to life as expressions of human beings.

Ernest Hemingway called the novel an American classic, and Crane&#39;s genius is as much apparent in his sharp, colorful prose as in his ironic portrayal of an episode of war so intense, so immediate, so real that the terror of battle becomes our own ... in a masterpiece so unique that many believe modern American fiction began with Stephen Crane.</p><h2>Queer Space: Architecture and Same-Sex Desire</h2><p>Examines the architectural innovations of gay men and women, explaining how &#34;queer spaces&#34; have been created through homosexuals&#39; experiences in a straight world and their desire to express themselves through design.

Rarely has the concept of how gay people relate to material space been addressed. Aaron Betsky's <i>Queer Space: Architecture and Same-Sex Desire</i> is an important, ground-breaking book that examines how homosexual people live in physical space and how they are in the forefront of creating new concepts of space, for themselves as well as for the rest of the world. <i>Queer Space</i> is smart, well written, and filled with illustrations. Betsky's thesis--that "the purpose of queer space is ultimately sex"--is passionately argued and highly convincing.

The sentences lodge themselves slowly in the reader's mind until they detonate with all the force of fused feeling and thought--the force of a metaphysical contemplation of the paradoxes of the human heart." <br>--<b>New York Times</b><br> <br>"A vivid, lingering novel...a brilliant work of art." <br>--<b>Cleveland Plain Dealer</b><br> <br>"All life is here...visions of love and hate I've never read before.

People who have survived a close brush with death reveal their extraordinary visions and ecstatic feelings at the moment they died, describing journeys through a tunnel to a realm of light, visual reviews of their past deeds, encounters with a benevolent spirit, and permanent transformation after returning to life.<br> Carol Zaleski's <em>Otherworld Journeys</em> offers the most comprehensive treatment to date of the evidence surrounding near-death experiences. The first to place researchers' findings, first-person accounts, and possible medical or psychological explanations in historical perspective, she discusses how these materials reflect the influence of contemporary culture. She demonstrates that modern near-death reports belong to a vast family of otherworld journey tales, with examples in nearly every religious heritage. She identifies universal as well as culturally specific features by comparing near-death narratives in two distinct periods of Western society: medieval Christendom and twentieth-century secular America. This comparison reveals profound similarities, such as the life-review and the transforming after-effects of the vision, as well as striking contrasts, such as the absence of hell or punishment scenes from modern accounts.<br> Mediating between the "debunkers" and the near-death researchers, Zaleski considers current efforts to explain near-death experience scientifically. She concludes by emphasizing the importance of the otherworld vision for understanding imaginative and religious experience in general.<br></p><p><br><strong>Carol Zaleski</strong> is a Lecturer on the Study of Religion at Harvard University.<br>"Zaleski's command of the literature, her careful analysis of the narratives, and her recommendations for interpretation make this book a classic in the study of religious experience and popular religion."--The Journal of Religion<br><br>"Zaleski...has had the excellent idea of putting recent near-death narratives in perspective by comparing them with those of an earlier period....An extremely interesting piece of work, and one that offers many shrewd insights."--John Gross, The New York Times<br><br>"The most important book on the topic."--Virginia Quarterly Review<br><br>"The most thorough, scholarly, and convincing study thus far published concerning the cultural and religious implications of near-death experiences....The most important book on the topic."--Virginia Quarterly Review<br><br>"A sophisticated postmodern, hence nonphilosophical, book about that timeless philosophical problem. The problem is how to explain mental objects (for example, a vision of heaven or an encounter with a leprechaun)."--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"The first historical perspective on the subject....A brilliant, historically rich, commonsensical book."--Jonathan Cott, Vogue<br><br>"An open-minded and scholarly study, impressive in its intelligence, fairness, humanity, and breadth."--Boston Phoenix<br><br>"A work at once scholarly and engrossingly readable....A rich and eminently successful work."--Robert Ellwood, Parabola<br><br>"Wide-ranging and profound, revealing the imaginative and symbolic content of such experiences as well as their relationship to particular cultural and religious beliefs."--Library Journal<br><br>"[Zaleski's] provocative book should be read by all people interested in near-death experiences."--The American Rationalist</p><h2>Leading with Questions: How Leaders Find the Right Solutions by Knowing What to Ask</h2><p><p>Many leaders are unaware of the amazing power of questions. Our conversations may be full of requests and demands, but all too often we are not asking for honest and informative answers, and we don&#x2019;t know how to listen effectively to responses. When leaders start encouraging questions from their teams, however, they begin to see amazing results. Knowing the right questions to ask&#x2014;and the right way to listen&#x2014;will give any leader the skills to perform well in any situation, effectively communicate a vision to the team, and achieve lasting success across the organization.</p> <p>Thoroughly revised and updated, <i>Leading with Questions</i> will help you encourage participation and teamwork, foster outside-the-box thinking, empower others, build relationships with customers, solve problems, and more. Michael Marquardt reveals how to determine which questions will lead to solutions to even the most challenging issues. He outlines specific techniques of active listening and follow-up, and helps you understand how questions can improve the way you work with individuals, teams, and organizations.</p> <p>This new edition of <i>Leading with Questions</i> draws on interviews with thirty leaders, including eight whose stories are new to this edition. These interviews tell stories from a range of countries, including Singapore, Guyana, Korea, and Switzerland, and feature case studies from prominent firms such as DuPont, Alcoa, Novartis, and Cargill. A new chapter on problem-solving will help you apply questions to your toughest situations as a leader, and a new &#x201c;Questions for Reflection&#x201d; section at the end of each chapter will help you bring Marquardt&#x2019;s message into all of your work as a leader.</p> <p>Now more than ever, <i>Leading with Questions</i> is the definitive guide for becoming a stronger leader by identifying&#x2014;and asking&#x2014;the right questions.</p></p><p><p><b>Praise for <i>Leading with Questions</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;When leaders ask questions&#x2014;and create organizational cultures that value questions&#x2014;great things happen.

From revolutionary politics to the new machine age, from war and depression to growth and prosperity, <i>20th-Century Dress in the United States</i> shows how fashion goes hand-in-hand with history. The authors examine American dress from 1898 to 2004 and find innovation at every turn. Diversity and complexity are key: far from the fashion stereotypes embodied by popular ideas of "the Twenties" or "the Sixties"-periods noted for their youthful upheaval and influence-we see how every era has its conformists and rebels, from the Arrow Collar Man and the Gibson Girl to flappers, bell-bottom-clad hippies, and Jackie Kennedy. Each chapter explores the social, cultural, economic, artistic, and technological themes that shape fashion in both festive and everyday clothing. Changes in retailing and manufacturing are also examined, from the sweatshops of yesterday to the Internet shopping of today. From high fashion to low, glitz to grunge, this vivid and comprehensive book explains what we wear on our backs-and why.</p><p>Jane Farrell-Beck and Jean Parsons teach at Iowa State University.

It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.<br><br> Dodgson's tale was published in 1865 as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by "Lewis Carroll" with illustrations by John Tenniel. The first print run of 2,000 was held back because Tenniel objected to the print quality. A new edition was quickly printed, released in December of the same year but carrying an 1866 date.<br><br> The entire print run sold out quickly. Alice was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Among its first avid readers were Queen Victoria and the young Oscar Wilde. The book has never been out of print. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has been translated into at least 174 languages. There have now been over a hundred English-language editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, especially theatre and film.</p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Seeking to understand the cultural origins of the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century, this text first looks at the scientific culture of the seventeenth century, focusing not only on England but following through with a study of the history of science and technology in France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Comparative in structure, this text explains why England was so much more successful at this transition than its continental counterparts. It also integrates science with worldly concerns, focusing mainly on the entrepreneurs and engineers who possessed scientific insight and who were eager to profit from its advantages, demonstrating that during the mid-seventeenth century, British science was presented within an ideological framework that encouraged material prosperity. Readable summaries of the major scientific achievements are included to better communicate the central innovations of the period, and recent scholarship is added to help enhance the discussion of the integration of science into Western culture. Blending the history of science and technology with cultural history, this text is ideal for early modern European history courses, as well as for courses in cultural studies and the history of science.<br></p><p>Margaret C. Jacob is at New School for Social Research.<br>"There has been a crying need for instructors of Western Civilization to find readable texts that incorporate the rise of science into the traditional historical curriculum.

In this classic book, the late Professor Minnaert accompanies the reader on a tour of nature&#39;s light and color and reveals the myriad phenomena that may be observed outdoors with no more than a pair of eyes and an enquiring mind. From the intriguing shape of the dapples beneath a tree on a sunny day, via rainbows, mirages, and haloes, the colors of liquid, ice, and the sky, to the appearance of the sun, moon, planets, and stars - Minnaert describes and explains them all in a clear language accessible to laymen. This new English edition is supplemented by 80 plates, over half of them in color, taken by the acclaimed photographer Pekka Parviainen, illustrating many of the phenomena - ordinary and exotic - discussed in the book.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Dutch"Minnaert's book is a gem!...It is a wonderful book that should be known by everyone who has an interest in the natural visual world."

This new biography, the culmination of many decades of study, presents an original interpretation of Savonarola's prophetic career and a highly nuanced assessment of his vision and motivations.</p><p>Weinstein sorts out the multiple strands that connect Savonarola to his time and place, following him from his youthful rejection of a world he regarded as corrupt, to his engagement with that world to save it from itself, to his shattering confession&#x2014;an admission that he had invented his prophesies and faked his visions. Was his confession sincere? A forgery circulated by his inquisitors? Or an attempt to escape bone-breaking torture? Weinstein offers a highly innovative analysis of the testimony to provide the first truly satisfying account of Savonarola and his fate as a failed prophet.</p></p><p><b>Donald Weinstein</b> is professor emeritus, University of Arizona.

Dmitri Nekhlyudov, called to jury service, is astonished to see in the dock, charged with murder, a young woman whom he once seduced, propelling her into prostitution. She is found guilty on a technicality, and he determines to overturn the verdict. This pitches him into a hellish labyrinth of Russian courts, prisons and bureaucracy, in which the author loses no opportunity for satire and bitter criticism of a state system (not confined to that country) of cruelty and injustice. This is Dickens for grown-ups, involving a hundred characters, Crime and Punishment brought forward half a century. With unforgettable set-pieces of sexual passion, conflict and social injustice, Resurrection proceeds from brothel to court-room, stinking cells to offices of state, luxury apartments to filthy life in Siberia. The ultimate crisis of moral responsibility embroils not only the famous author and his hero, but also you and me. Can we help resolve the eternal issues of law and imprisonment?</p><p></p><h2>The Metabolism Plan: Discover the Foods and Exercises that Work for Your Body to Reduce Inflammation and Drop Pounds Fast</h2><p><b>The New York Times bestselling author of The Plan is back to help readers customize their diet and exercise less to lose more weight! </b><br>The Plan -- the instant New York Times and USA Today bestseller that helped readers pinpoint which "healthy" foods were making them gain weight -- has helped hundreds of thousands of readers slim down.

It depicts the fall and rise of the Primrose family, presided over by the benevolent vicar, the narrator of a fairy-tale plot of impersonation and deception, the abduction of a beautiful heroine and the machinations of an aristocratic villain. By turns comic and sentimental, the novel's popularity owes much to its recognizable depiction of domestic life and loving family relationships. <br><br> Regarded by some as a straightforward and well-intentioned novel of sentiment, and by others as a satire on the very literary conventions and morality it seems to embody, <em>The Vicar of Wakefield </em>contains, in the figure of the vicar himself, one of the most harmlessly simply and unsophisticated yet also ironically complex narrators ever to appear in English fiction. <br> ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.</p><p>Title: Vicar of Wakefield &lt;&gt;Binding: Paperback &lt;&gt;Author: Goldsmith, Oliver &lt;&gt;Publisher: OXFORD WORLD'S CLASSICSRobert L.

There&#39;s a reason WESTERN CIVILIZATION is the best seller: it makes the &#34;story of history&#34; come alive. Spielvogel&#39;s text is also loaded with extras, like &#34;Film and History&#34; features that show you a new approach to studying history. Colorful maps and visuals, plus dramatic first-hand historical accounts, combine to bring to life the stories of the people and events that have shaped Western civilization.</p><p>Jackson J. Spielvogel is Associate Professor Emeritus of History at The Pennsylvania State University. He received his Ph.D. from The Ohio State University, where he specialized in Reformation history under Harold J. Grimm. His articles and reviews have appeared in journals such as Moreana, Journal of General Education, Catholic Historical Review, Archiv f�r Reformationsgeschichte, and American Historical Review. He also has contributed chapters or articles to The Social History of Reformation, THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE: A DICTIONARY HANDBOOK, the Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual of Holocaust Studies, and Utopian Studies. His work has been supported by fellowships from the Fulbright Foundation and the Foundation for Reformation Research. At Penn State, he helped inaugurate the Western Civilization course, as well as a popular course on Nazi Germany. His book HITLER AND NAZI GERMANY was published in 1987 (7th Edition, 2013). He is also the author of WESTERN CIVILIZATION, first published in 1991 (9th Edition, 2015). Professor Spielvogel has won five major university-wide teaching awards. During the year 1988?1989, he held the Penn State Teaching Fellowship, the university&#39;s most prestigious teaching award. In 1996, he won the Dean Arthur Ray Warnock Award for Outstanding Faculty member, and in 2000 received the Schreyer Honors College Excellence in Teaching Award."The chronologies, timelines, and boxed documents all add greatly to the overall quality of the text. My students would be lost without them. ... I like this text and expect to continue to use it for the next several years."<br><br>"Dr. Spielvogel's lucid prose, apt illustrations, and excellent maps make his a text for which I find it difficult to imagine finding a close rival. ... The coherence resulting from its being a single-author text is valuable in a general education course. ... It is a very impressive textbook and the author and publisher alike ought to take great pride in their work. ... I would not only consider adopting Jackson J. Spielvogel's WESTERN CIVILIZATION text, but would, furthermore, actively lobby for its adoption for use at our university. A wealth of information in keeping with the scholarship at our disposal is presented in an appealing format. Never sacrificing well-written content, the text appeals to a generation reared on media in living color."<br><br>"The Spielvogel text does a good job of communicating with students. The vocabulary ... is not too difficult, and the literary style is almost conversational."<br><br>"The faculty who adopted Spielvogel ... did so because the text read clearly and told a coherent story of historical change and development. Students comment that the text is well written, clearly organized, and interesting. Chapter titles and major headings mark chronological and thematic connections but place greatest emphasis on the conceptual development. ... National histories are mentioned but do not dominate; and art, literature, and music are not ignored. ... The special features are one of the greatest strengths of Spielvogel."</p><h2>The Battle Is the Lord&#39;s: Waging Victorious Spiritual Warfare</h2><p>In The Battle Is the Lord&#39;s, Tony Evans reveals Satan&#39;s strategies, teaches how you can fight back against the forces of darkness, and shows you how to find deliverance from the devil&#39;s snares.</p><p>Tony Evans is the senior pastor of Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, and president of The Urban Alternative, a ministry devoted to bringing about change in urban communities through the church.

His systematic attempt to outline a psycho-physical technique for acting single-handedly revolutionized standards of acting in the theatre.</p> <p></p> <p>Until now, readers and students have had to contend with inaccurate, misleading and difficult-to-read English-language versions. Some of the mistranslations have resulted in profound distortions in the way his system has been interpreted and taught. At last, Jean Benedetti has succeeded in translating Stanislavski&#x2019;s huge manual into a lively, fascinating and accurate text in English.&nbsp;He has remained faithful to the author's original intentions, putting the two books previously known as <em>An Actor Prepares</em> and <em>Building A Character</em> back together into one volume, and in a colloquial and readable style for today's actors. </p> <p> </p><p></p>The result is a major contribution to the theatre, and a service to one of the great innovators of the twentieth century.</p><p><p><strong>'A lively new translation by Jean Benedetti...

In <i>Homos</i>, he studies the historical, political, and philosophical grounds for the current distrust, within the gay community, of self-identifying moves, for the paradoxical desire to be invisibly visible. While acknowledging the dangers of any kind of group identification (if you can be singled out, you can be disciplined), Bersani argues for a bolder presentation of what it means to be gay.

His spectacular theory of "homo-ness" will be of interest to straights as well as gays, for it designates a mode of connecting to the world embodied in, but not reducible to, a sexual preference. The gay identity Bersani advocates is more of a force--as such, rather cool to the modest goal of social tolerance for diverse lifestyles--which can lead to a massive redefining of sociality itself, and of what we might expect from human communities.</p></p><p>Hardly a day goes by without the media focusing an often sympathetic beam on gay life - and, with AIDS, on gay death.

Bluman, Professor Emeritus, Community College of Allegheny County</p><p>I was born and raised in Cleveland, and started college at Bowling Green State University in 1984 majoring in creative writing. Eleven years later, I walked across the graduation stage to receive a PhD in math, a strange journey indeed. After two years at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, I came home to Ohio, accepting a tenure-track job at the Hamilton campus of Miami University. I&#x2019;ve won a number of teaching awards in my career, and while maintaining an active teaching schedule, I now spend an inordinate amount of time writing textbooks and course materials. I&#x2019;ve written or co-authored either seven or twelve textbooks, depending on how you count them, as well as several solutions manuals and interactive CD-ROMS. After many years as developmental math coordinator at Miami Hamilton, I share the frustration that goes along with low pass rates in the developmental math curriculum. Far too many students end up on the classic Jetson&#x2019;s-style treadmill, with the abstract nature of the traditional algebra curriculum keeping them from reaching their goals. Like so many instructors across the country, I believe the time is right to move beyond the one-size-fits-all curriculum that treats students the same whether they hope to be an engineer or a pastry chef. &#x201c;Because we&#x2019;ve always done it that way&#x201d; is NOT a good reason to maintain the status quo in our curriculum. Let&#x2019;s work together to devise alternate pathways that help students to learn more and learn better while hastening their trip into credit-bearing math courses. Since my book (Math in Our World) is written for the Liberal Arts Math and Quantitative Literacy market, I think I&#x2019;m in the right place at the right time to make a difference in the new and exciting pathways course. I&#x2019;m in a very happy place right now: my love of teaching meshes perfectly with my childhood dream of writing. (Don&#x2019;t tell my publisher this &#x2013; they think I spend 20 hours a day working on textbooks &#x2013; but I&#x2019;m working on my first novel in the limited spare time that I have.) I&#x2019;m also a former coordinator of Ohio Project NExT, as I believe very strongly in helping young college instructors focus on high-quality teaching as a primary career goal. I live in Fairfield, Ohio with my lovely wife Cat and fuzzy dogs Macleod and Tessa. When not teaching or writing, my passions include Ohio State football, Cleveland Indians baseball, heavy metal music, travel, golf, and home improvement.</p><h2>Global Health Care: Issues and Policies (Holtz, Global Health Care)</h2><p>This revised edition equips students with up-to-date information on a variety of global health topics and perspectives. It prepares readers with a basic perspective of health policy issues in various geographical regions, and explains how they are affected by significant world events.</p><p></p><h2>Moby-Dick: Or, The Whale (The Northwestern-Newberry Edition of the Writings of Herman Melville, Vol. 6)</h2><p>In <i>Moby Dick </i>Melville set out to write a "mighty book" on "a mighty theme." The editors of this critical text affirm that he succeeded. Nevertheless, their prolonged examination of the novel reveals textual flaws and anomalies that help to explain Melville's fears that his great work was in some ways a hash or a botch. A lengthy historical note also gives a fresh account of Melville's earlier literary career and his working conditions as he wrote; it also analyzes the book's contemporary reception and outlines how it finally achieved fame. Other sections review theories of the book's genesis, detail the circumstances of its publication, and present documents closely relating to the story.<br><br>This scholarly edition is based on collations of both editions published during Melville's lifetime, it adopts 185 revisions and corrections from the English edition and incorporates 237 emendations by the series editors. This is an Approved Text of the Center for Editions of American Authors (Modern Language Association of America).<br></p><p>Burt Reynolds reading this story brings expression, meaning and action to the chase of a lifetime. Mr. Reynolds has starred in countless films, including the Bandit series. He also starred in the long-running series, Evening Shade.Herman Melville was born August 1, 1819 in New York City. Son of a prosperous importer and a famous grandfather, Melville became a prolific writer at a very young age. Melville died on September 28, 1891.</p><h2>Fashion at the Edge: Spectacle, Modernity, and Deathliness</h2><p><p><b>What do images of illness, vampirism, wounds, and addiction say about contemporary fashion? An unexpected discussion of fashion and its relation to deep cultural anxieties</b><br><br> Recent experimental fashion has a dark side, a preoccupation with representations of death, trauma, alienation, and decay. This intriguing book looks closely at this strand of fashion design in the 1990s, exploring what its disturbing themes tell us about consumer culture and contemporary anxieties. Caroline Evans analyzes the work of experimental designers, the images of fashion photographers, and the spectacular fashion shows that developed in the final decade of the twentieth century to arrive at a new understanding of fashion&#x2019;s dark side and what it signifies.&nbsp;<i>Fashion at the Edge </i>considers<i></i>a range of cutting-edge contemporary fashion in unprecedented depth and detail, including the work of such current designers as John Galliano, Alexander McQueen, Hussein Chalayan, and Viktor &amp; Rolf. Contrasting images by photographers like Steven Meisel, Nick Knight, and Juergen Teller are also reviewed. Drawing on diverse perspectives from Marx to Walter Benjamin, Evans shows that fashion stands at the very center of the contemporary, and that it voices some of Western culture&#x2019;s deepest concerns.</p></p><p>&#34;Evans grapples with extremely interesting issues, such as why fashion imagery has become so dark and decadent. Her choice of contemporary fashion imagery-and her juxtaposition of these images with similar themes in art-is brilliant.&#34;-Valerie Steele, Director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology<p><b>Caroline Evans </b>is reader in fashion studies, Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, London.

They have become part of the popular imagination of the Western world. Passed down from ancient Babylon, Egypt, and Greece, these words and the rituals surrounding them have survived through the millennia because they work. And as scholar Claude Lecouteux reveals, often the more impenetrable they seem, the more effective they are. <br> <br>Analyzing more than 7,000 spells from the magical traditions of Europe as well as the magical papyri of the Greeks and recently discovered one-of-a-kind grimoires from Scandinavia, France, and Germany, Lecouteux has compiled a comprehensive dictionary of ancient magic words, phrases, and spells along with an in-depth exploration--the first in English--of secret magical alphabets, including those based on Hebrew letters, Kabbalistic symbols, astrological signs, and runes. Drawing upon thousands of medieval accounts and famous manuscripts such as the Heptameron of Peter Abano, the author examines the origins of each word or spell, offering detailed instructions on their successful use, whether for protection, love, wealth, or healing. He charts their evolution and derivations through the centuries, showing, for example, how spells that were once intended to put out fires evolved to protect people from witchcraft. He reveals the inherent versatility of magic words and how each sorcerer or witch had a set of stock phrases they would combine to build a custom spell for the magical need at hand. <br> <br>Presenting a wealth of material on magical words, signs, and charms, both common and obscure, Lecouteux also explores the magical words and spells of ancient Scandinavia, the Hispano-Arabic magic of Spain before the Reconquista, the traditions passed down from ancient Egypt, and those that have stayed in use until the present day.</p><p>Claude Lecouteux is a former professor of medieval literature and civilization at the Sorbonne. He is the author of numerous books on medieval and pagan beliefs and magic, including <i>The Book of Grimoires</i>, <i>The Tradition of Household Spirits</i>, <i>A Lapidary of Sacred Stones</i>, and <i>The</i> <i>High Magic of Talismans</i> <i>and Amulets</i>.

It discusses Plato's conception of the virtues; his views about the connection between the virtues and happiness; and the account of reason, desire, and motivation that underlies his arguments about the virtues. Plato's answer to the epistemological question, "How can we know how we ought to live?" is also discussed. His views on knowledge, belief, and inquiry, and his theory of Forms, are examined, insofar as they are relevant to his ethical view. Terence Irwin traces the development of Plato's moral philosophy, from the Socratic dialogues to its fullest exposition in the <em>Republic</em>. <em>Plato's Ethics</em> discusses Plato's reasons for abandoning or modifying some aspects of Socratic ethics, and for believing that he preserves Socrates' essential insights. A brief and selective discussion of the <em>Statesmen</em>, <em>Philebus</em>, and <em>Laws</em> is included. Replacing Irwin's earlier <em>Plato's Moral Theory</em> (Oxford, 1977), this book gives a clearer and fuller account of the main questions and discusses some recent controversies in the interpretation of Plato's ethics. It does not presuppose any knowledge of Greek or any extensive knowledge of Plato.<br></p><p><br><strong>Terence Irwin</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Cornell University and author of several books on ancient philosophy, including <em>Classical Thought</em> (Oxford, 1988), <em>Aristotle's First Principles</em> (Oxford, 1988), and <em>Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics</em> (1985).<br><br>"Many will regard the new work as one of the better places to begin their background reading on the ethics of Plato....Recommended."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"<em>Plato's Ethics</em> is a model of how to enter into another's mind by making full use of one's own. Reflective readers will gain many insights into Plato's philosophy, and into the art of doing ancient philosophy."--<em>Ancient Philosophy</em><p></p><br>"...<em>Plato's Ethics</em> is an exceptionally coherent and cogent book. Its arguments set a standard of clarity worthy of emulation by champions and critics alike, and I suspect this book will appear as a regular entry in bibliographies for some time,"--E.E. Benitez, <em>The Review of Metaphysics</em><p></p><br>"<em>Plato's Moral Theory</em> was one of the classic works of ancient philosophy scholarship of this century and <em>Plato's Ethics</em> should be at least as influential.

In fact, all myriad influences that shaped modern civilization in the Mediterranean come together in Southern Italy and Sicily. The world's first secular university was founded in Naples. Many of the elements of Italian culture as we now know it in the rest of the world&#x2015;from comic opera to pizza&#x2015;were born in the South. Art and music flourished there, as did progressive ideas about education, tolerance, and civic administration.<br><br> Native Neopolitan and distinguished scholar Tommaso Astarita gives us a history both erudite and full of personality&#x2015;from the freethinking, cosmopolitan King Frederick who conferred with Jewish and Muslim philosophers (and dared to meet with the Sultan) to the fisherman Masaniello who inspired artists and revolutionaries across Europe. In the medieval South, Jews, Muslims, and Greek and Latin Christians could practice their religions, speak their languages, and live in mostly peaceful cohabitation. From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, Naples was on par with Paris, one of the largest and most cultured cities in Europe. During the Enlightenment, southern Italy captured the European imagination, and many people traveled far and wide to enjoy southern Italy's ancient ruins, beautiful landscapes, sweet music, and magnificent art, marveling at the lively temperament of the southern population. The drama and beauty of the region inspired visitors to claim that one had to "see Naples, and then die." Yet negative images of the Italian South's poverty, violence, superstition and nearness to Africa long fueled stereotypes of what was and was not acceptably "European." Goethe noted that he had gladly studied in Rome, but in Naples he wanted "only to live," for "Naples is a Paradise: everyone lives in a state of intoxicated self-forgetfulness, myself included.<br><br> From the Normans and Angevins through Spanish and Bourbon rule to the unification of Italy in 1860 and the subsequent emigration of vast numbers of Southern Italians, <em>Between Salt Water and Holy Water</em> captures the rich, dynamic past of a vibrant land.</p><p>Tommaso Astarita is a professor of history at Georgetown University. He is a native Neapolitan and currently lives in Washington, DC.The history of Italy tends to focus on events from Rome northward, too often giving short shift to the peculiarly named "Kingdom of the Two Sicilies." Astarita does a masterful job of correcting this error and bringing to life for English speakers the people and events of these lands so central to the entire Mediterranean basin. European by geography, the region had close ties to Africa from the time of Carthage onward. Post-Roman Empire southern Italy fell under the sway of the Normans in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and Astarita recounts the era of kings Roger I and II, who dealt with the diverse powers of the papacy and sizable Muslim populations in their realm. Astarita is at his best discussing South Italy and Sicily's social history, the roles of religion and superstition as animating forces in the populace's everyday lives. A highly readable history, this volume will be enthusiastically received wherever there are concentrations of Italian-Americans. Population tables and genealogical charts add to the text's clarity. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A sometime Navy SEAL (whose real-life exploits in Vietnam were chronicled in the 1992 bestseller Rogue Warrior), Marcinko has had an active (if fictive) post-retirement career in which he offers caustic first-person accounts of dirty jobs done for low-profile agencies of the US government (Rogue Warrior: Task Force Blue, 1996, etc.). On this outing, the salty soldier of fortune raises enough homicidal hell with mafiya goons and corrupt officials to get himself expelled from Russia. Although scarcely more welcome in Washington's upper echelons, he has come away with evidence that minions of the Kremlin are smuggling nuclear material to Syria through Werner Lantos, a shady Hungarian middleman who works out of Paris. Joining forces with Avi Ben Gal (an old pal from Israel's security service), Tricky Dick heads for the City of Light, where he and his three-man team learn that the venal go-between is at the heart of a vast conspiracy to restore the erstwhile Soviet Union's superpower status and trigger a renewal of the Cold War. While well-placed traitors in their own governments resist them at every turn, Dick and Avi resourcefully manage to mount an airborne raid on a covert atomic-weapons installation near Damascus. In a climactic engagement notable for their unwonted reliance on guile as well as firepower, the two lay waste to the secret ordnance facility, bag the reptilian Lantos, and determine who should pay for the transnational plot's near-miss horrors. With sociopolitical asides (on Bill Clinton, equal employment opportunity in the armed forces, and allied targets of opportunity) as hard-hitting as the narrative action, the aging but perdurably macho man delivers another diverting road show.

Jonathan Eig's masterful narrative revolves around four principal characters: the fiery feminist Margaret Sanger, who was a champion of birth control in her campaign for the rights of women but neglected her own children in pursuit of free love; the beautiful Katharine McCormick, who owed her fortune to her wealthy husband, the son of the founder of International Harvester and a schizophrenic; the visionary scientist Gregory Pincus, who was dismissed by Harvard in the 1930s as a result of his experimentation with <em>in vitro</em> fertilization but who, after he was approached by Sanger and McCormick, grew obsessed with the idea of inventing a drug that could stop ovulation; and the telegenic John Rock, a Catholic doctor from Boston who battled his own church to become an enormously effective advocate in the effort to win public approval for the drug that would be marketed by Searle as Enovid.</p><p>Spanning the years from Sanger&#x2019;s heady Greenwich Village days in the early twentieth century to trial tests in Puerto Rico in the 1950s to the cusp of the sexual revolution in the 1960s, this is a grand story of radical feminist politics, scientific ingenuity, establishment opposition, and, ultimately, a sea change in social attitudes.

Decades in preparation, the <i>DARE</i> corpus reflects the liveliness of English as it is spoken on America&#x2019;s main streets and country roads&#x2015;the regional metaphors and similes passed along within homes and communities.</p><p>Like its popular predecessor, Volume II is a treasury of vernacular Americanisms. In Virginia a goldfinch is a <i>dandelion bird</i>, in Missouri an insufficient rain shower a <i>drizzle-fizzle</i>. <i>Gate</i> was Louis Armstrong&#x2019;s favorite <i>sender</i> (a verbal spur to a sidekick in a band), a usage that probably originated from the fact that gates swing. Readers will bedazzled by the wealth of entries&#x2015;more than 11,000&#x2015;contained in this second volume alone. The two and a half pages on &#x201c;dirt&#x201d; reveal that a small marble is a <i>dirt pea</i> in the South. To <i>eat dried apples</i>, a curious rural euphemism for becoming pregnant, appears in the five pages on &#x201c;eat.&#x201d; Seven pages on &#x201c;horn&#x201d; and related words take readers on a tour of the animal and nether worlds: <i>horned lark</i>, <i>horned frog</i>, <i>horned pout</i> (look that one up), and that <i>horned fellow</i>, the devil.</p><p>Initiated under the leadership of Frederic G. Cassidy, <i>DARE</i> represents an unprecedented attempt to document the living language of the entire country. The project&#x2019;s primary tool was a carefully worded survey of 1,847 questions touching on most aspects of everyday life and human experience. Over a five-year period fieldworkers interviewed natives of 1,002 communities, a patchwork of the United States in all its diversity.</p><p>The result is a database of more than two and a half million items&#x2015;a monument to the richness of American folk speech. Additionally, some 7,000 publications, including novels, diaries, and small-town newspapers, have yielded a bountiful harvest of local idioms. Computer-generated maps accompanying many of the entries illustrate the regional distribution of words and phrases.</p><p>The entries contained in Volume II&#x2015;from the poetic and humorous to the witty and downright bawdy&#x2015;will delight and inform readers.</p></p><p>Volume II is every bit as excellent as A-C, and as thought provoking. It&#39;s sad to have lost words like faunch (to rant, rage, or fret). The words form a picture of the country a century back, when folks stored their stuff in a hide-nasty (closet), and when they hifered (loitered) and someone asked what they were up to, they might say &#34;Oh, I&#39;m just helping Andy&#34; (doing nothing). The lesson: If I faunch less and just put projects away in the hide-nasty, I can hifer more and take up the art of helping Andy.<p>Frederic G. Cassidy was Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.</p><p>Joan Houston Hall is Distinguished Scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She joined the <i>DARE</i> staff in 1975, became Associate Editor in 1979, and was named Chief Editor in 2000.</p></p><h2>Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics, Technology Update</h2><p>Achieve success in your physics course by making the most of what PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS Ninth Edition Technology Edition has to offer.

In this comprehensive introduction to hypnosis based on the pioneering work of Milton H. Erickson, Bill O'Hanlon demystifies the concept of "trance" and "hypnosis." He goes to the heart of the subject by answering the question: "What is trance?" But be forewarned: This is no dry, formal discourse on trance induction techniques. Rather, readers are invited to share the experience of attending one of O'Hanlon's lively and popular two-day workshops on Ericksonian hypnosis. In an energetic and often humorous manner, O'Hanlon takes his audience through the basics of trance induction and explains the how, what, and why of hypnosis. Readers familiar with Erickson's work will be delighted at the author's Class of Problems/Class of Solutions approach, which deconstructs Ericksonian interventions and provides a powerful new tool in directing clients toward solution. Each individual element of trance induction is explained clearly, through the use of case examples, demonstrations, and audience participation exercises. The book's gradual approach takes readers through the hypnotic process in a step-by-step fashion, increasing their skills and confidence.</p><p>Bill O&#x2019;Hanlon, is a founder of Possibility and Inclusive Therapies and is the author or coauthor of more than thirty books, including Out of the Blue, Becoming A Published Therapist, and Quick Steps to Resolving Trauma.

Hume &#x2014; whom Kant famously credited with having "interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my investigations in the field of speculative philosophy a quite new direction" &#x2014; intended this work as an observationally grounded study of human nature. He employed John Locke's empiric principles, constructing a theory of knowledge to serve as a foundation for the evaluation of metaphysical ideas.<br>Reprinted here in one volume, the <i>Treatise</i> begins with an examination of the nature of ideas: their origins and connections, modes and substance, and abstract qualities. The work's considerations of existence, knowledge, and identity explore the ways in which people use these concepts as a basis for firm but unproven beliefs. The second part surveys the passions, from pride and humility to contempt and respect, analyzing their roles in human choices and actions. The book concludes with a meditation on morals and an in-depth explanation of the perceived distinctions between virtue and vice.<br>One of philosophy's most important works and a key to modern studies of 18th-century Western thought, <i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i> is essential reading for all students of philosophy and history.</p></p><p>David Hume was an eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher, historian, and essayist, and the author of A Treatise of Human Nature, considered by many to be one of the most important philosophical works ever published.<p>Hume attended the University of Edinburgh at an early age and considered a career in law before deciding that the pursuit of knowledge was his true calling. Hume s writings on rationalism and empiricism, free will, determinism, and the existence of God would be enormously influential on contemporaries such as Adam Smith, as well as the philosophers like Schopenhauer, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Popper, who succeeded him. Hume died in 1776.</p>`These new Oxford University Press editions have been meticulously collated from various exatant versions. Each text has an excellent introduction including an overview of Hume's thought and an account of his life and times. Even the difficult, and rarely commented-on, chapters on space and<br>time are elucidated. There are also useful notes on the text and glossary. These scholarly new editions are ideally adapted for a whole range of readers, from beginners to experts.'<br>Jane O'Grady, Catholic Herald, 4/8/00.<br><br>One of the greatest of all philosophical works, covering knowledge, imaginatio, emotion, morality and justice. Hume is down-to-earth, capable of putting other, pretentious philosophers down, but deeply sceptical even about his own reasoning. Baroness Warnock, The List, The Week<br>18/11/2000</p><h2>Henry V (English Monarchs Series)</h2><p>Thanks to Shakespeare, Henry V is one of England's best-known monarchs. Or is he? The image of the young king leading his army against the French and his stunning victory at Agincourt are part of English historical tradition. Yet to understand Henry V we need to look at far more than his military prowess.<br><br>While Henry was indeed a soldier of exceptional skills, his historical reputation as a king deserves to be set against a broader background of achievement, for he was a leader and a diplomat, an administrator, a keeper of the peace and protector of the Church, a man who worked with and for his people.<br><br>This new study, the first full scholarly biography of Henry V, based on the primary sources of both English and French archives and taking into account a great deal of recent scholarship, shows his reign in the broad European context of his day. It concludes that, through his personality and "professional" approach, Henry not only united the country in war but also provided England with a sense of pride and the kind of domestic rule it was so in need of at the time.<br><br>Allmand offers far more than a biography of a king. His book is also a rich work of cultural history, with fascinating material on, for example, royal funerals, the reburial of Richard II in Westminster Abbey, the rise of Lollardy in England, and how one governed in the late Middle Ages.</p><p><b>Christopher Allmand</b> is Professor of History at the University of Liverpool. His previous books include <i>Lancastrian Normandy, 1415-1450</i> and <i>The Hundred Years War</i>.In this volume, we are presented with an in-depth and generally balanced portrait of the monarch who is best remembered for his success at the Battle of Agincourt (1415). However, as Allmand (Univ. of Liverpool) shows, Henry V was a versatile, capable ruler whose achievements in many areas were of lasting significance. Like most of its predecessors in the "English Monarchs" series, this work is written in a style designed to appeal not only to scholars but to general readers. Undergraduate students of British history, in particular, will be beneficiaries of this work. Deeply researched and well written, this is now the standard biography of Henry V.<br><i>- James A.

It is the very question that Nigel Warburton demystifies in this brilliant and accessible little book. With the help of varied illustrations and photographs, from C�zanne and Francis Bacon to Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, best-selling author Warburton brings a philosopher's eye to art in a refreshing jargon-free style.<br>With customary clarity, he explains art theories, that are much discussed but little understood, by thinkers such as Clive Bell, R.G Collingwood and Wittgenstein. He illuminates other perplexing problems in art, such as the artist's intention, representation and emotion. Drawing on photographs of Cindy Sherman and Tiananmen Square, Warburton shows that, if we are ever to answer the art question, we must consider each work of art on its own terms.<br>A stimulating and handy guide through the art maze, <em>The Art Question</em> is essential reading for anyone interested in art, philosophy or those who simply like looking at and thinking about pictures.</p><p>Nigel Warburton is Lecturer in Philosophy at the Open University.

The feats of her priests and magicians were renowned throughout the ancient world, from the simplest legerdemain (according to present interpretation) to the heights of necromancy and sorcery. Even their most severe critics, the ancient Hebrews, admitted the power of Egyptian magic. In the famous sorcerers' duel between Moses and Egyptian priests before Pharaoh, the Egyptians were almost as skilled as Moses.<br>This well-known study of ancient Egyptian magic, by E. A. Wallis Budge, long curator of Egyptian antiquities at the British Museum, sums up everything that is known about the wonder-working of ancient Egypt. After a general discussion of the role of magic in Egyptian religion proper &#x2014; Dr. Budge covers the powerful amulets that warded off evil spirits; the scarabs of immortality; the use of wax images and spirit placements; magical pictures and formulas; magic via the secret name; magic of sounds; rituals; curses; destruction of hostile magic; determination of fortunate dates, and many of the other practices of the ancient Nile dwellers.<br>Dozens of magic formulas are given in full &#x2014; both in the original Egyptian sounds, as far as they can be recreated &#x2014; and in English; dozens of excerpts are also given from the magical papyroi, tomb inscriptions, and other sources. Many wonderful tales are told in these Egyptian stories; mind control, enforcing will upon animals, suspended animation, calling up the dead, finding ancient books of incredible magical power, and other miraculous events that we may or may not believe.</p><p></p></p><p>In this classic work, first published in 1899, one of the most prolific Egyptologists of the Victorian era offers his renowned insight into the magical power names, spells, and talismans held for the ancient Egyptians. How did beliefs that predated the worship of deities come to become associated with controlling gods and goddesses? How did magical amulets ward off evil spirits? What role did scarabs serve in bestowing immortality? <p> The writings of E.A. Wallis Budge are considered somewhat controversial today because of his use of an archaic system of translation, but useful illustrations and an abundance of information make them necessary works for students of ancient civilizations as well as those of the evolution of historical study. This entertaining overview of the connection between religion and magic in ancient Egypt remain a vital resource today.</p>E. A.

A friend of mine, a painter from South Africa, left a copy of Ngugi&#x2019;s essay collection <i>Decolonising the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature</i> in my apartment with the instruction to read it if I wanted to &#x201c;free my mind.&#x201d; These days it is hard to read such words without thinking first of the 1999 blockbuster science fiction movie <i>The Matrix</i>, in which humans have become slaves to technology, which has imprisoned them in a picture-perfect virtual world. While most people in the film move around oblivious to the fact that they are literally sleeping through life, a select few experience discontent with the perceived order and long for something more. They are offered a choice between the blue pill, a chance to erase all indications of their discontent, and the red pill, an opportunity to explore the twists and turns of an enlightened life. Their problem is that freeing the mind requires that they embrace a contradiction: their world is built on a fallacy and this fallacy provides a foundation for what can be an expansive&#x2014;if difficult&#x2014;new life.</p> <p>Ngugi&#x2019;s body of work, from his 1965 novel <i>The River Between</i> to his 2012 memoir <i>In the House of the Interpreter</i>, is the red pill, delivering readers from a simplistic understanding of the forces of colonialism in Africa to a complicated imagining of Africa before, during, and after colonialism. <i>Decolonising</i> <i>the Mind</i>, first published in 1986, some ten years after he wrote <i>Petals of Blood</i>, the last novel he wrote in English, is Ngugi&#x2019;s self-described &#x201c;farewell to English as a vehicle for any of my writings,&#x201d;1 and it provides great insight into the motivation for all of Ngugi&#x2019;s writing, but especially for <i>The River Between </i>and his other early novels.</p> <p>In <i>Decolonising the Mind</i>,<i> </i>one of the most marvelous analyses of the colonized (or formerly colonized) person&#x2019;s existential predicament since Frantz Fanon&#x2019;s <i>The Wretched of the Earth</i> or <i>Black Skin, White Masks</i>, Ngugi explores the role that language plays in the process of colonization and in the long and incomplete struggle to emerge from colonialism&#x2019;s shadow. It is not an easy text, primarily because it advocates abandoning many assumptions that the postcolonial African (which is to say every living African) has about the struggle for freedom and the institutions that structure everyday life. Ngugi&#x2019;s unpacking of the damage done to independence movements by Africans being forced to use the colonizers&#x2019; languages to express discontent calls into question the authenticity of the work he chose to write in English, but such is the attitude of Ngugi, a writer profoundly allergic to the simple. Ngugi describes African existence as a struggle between two competing forces, an imperialist tradition and a resistance tradition:</p> <p>The biggest weapon wielded and actually daily unleashed by imperialism against that collective defiance is the cultural bomb. The effect of a cultural bomb is to annihilate a people&#x2019;s belief in their names, in their languages, in their environment, in their heritage of struggle, in their unity, in their capacities and ultimately in themselves.2</p> <p>For Ngugi, imperialism extends well beyond the period of European expansion into Africa following the infamous Berlin Conference of 1884&#x2013;85, which divided the continent&#x2019;s peoples among European fiefdoms. Ngugi&#x2019;s imperialism is not a time-bound event. It is an infectious mind-set that radically corrupts self-perceptions and sociohistorical narratives, a constant and dynamic process initiated to cause</p> <p>despair, despondency and a collective death wish. Amidst this wasteland which it has created, imperialism presents itself as the cure and demands that the dependant sing hymns of praise with the constant refrain: &#x201c;Theft is holy.&#x201d; Indeed, this refrain sums up the new creed of the neocolonial bourgeoisie in many independent African states.3</p> <p>A disease that offers itself as its own cure? A problem that presents itself as its own solution? This is the circular reasoning against which Ngugi argues in his critical nonfiction and his fiction. His oeuvre is unapologetically ideological while at the same time concerned with the aesthetics that distinguish art from propaganda. Ngugi describes his approach to writing like this:</p> <p>First of all let me say [that] writing out of ideological convictions, of course, is very important. One has important ideas that arouse one&#x2019;s anger, passion [and] commitment.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But of course when one is actually writing fiction or poetry and so on it is very important that one lets those ideas emerge from concrete reality.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In other words, to try and not necessarily impose those ideas on the situation.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So the fictional narrative has to be artistically compelling to the reader and I would say this is a challenge to fiction writers. Because there is no way we can simply impose your views, your ideology, no matter how much you are convinced of that ideology, onto a situation. Rather the situation concretely should be the one that generates those ideas.4</p> <p>&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;</p> <p>It is with this in mind that we can now turn to Ngugi&#x2019;s <i>The River Between</i>, the first novel he wrote&#x2014;and the second to be published&#x2014;in a career that spans numerous works in multiple languages. It is perhaps one of the first pieces of African fiction to deliberately address the complex thoughts and feelings of Africans about living under colonialism.</p> <p>Written during Ngugi&#x2019;s final years as a student of English at Makerere University, an affiliate of the University of London in Kampala, Uganda, <i>The River Between</i> was first published a year after his novel <i>Weep Not, Child </i>(1964), which he wrote after <i>The River Between.</i> It represents an inflection point in his life, marking his transition from amateur artist to professional craftsman. More important, it presents evidence of an evolution of his attitude toward the colonial apparatus that would eventually lead to his decision to write only in Gikuyu as a means of celebrating African literary and cultural traditions while escaping the bubble of a petite bourgeoisie readership in favor of a readership of the masses.</p> <p>Ngugi has chronicled his literary and personal growth in several memoirs that speak both fondly and critically of the colonial education he received. He developed a love of the English literary canon and Christian religious traditions while living through numerous pre-independence upheavals&#x2014;the Mau Mau rebellion among them&#x2014;in which the British, who were responsible for his education and for introducing him to the Christian church, imprisoned his brother and tortured his mother during a state of emergency. In a sustained exploration of how James Ngugi, admirer of Conrad and the Bible, became Ngugi wa Thiong&#x2019;o, firebrand postcolonial novelist and imperialist critic, the scholar Carol Sicherman suggests that Ngugi&#x2019;s personal experience along with an undercurrent of campus revolutionary spirit gave rise to a transformation that finds expression in his early work. She also cites the 1962 African Writers Conference, which exposed for Ngugi and other East African writers the lack of literary material produced in their region as compared to southern and western Africa.5 It was around this time that Ngugi ventured to show his manuscript of <i>The River Between</i> to Hugh Dinwiddy, a British faculty member at Makerere. Dinwiddy remembers saying, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time we had some African novelists. We can&#x2019;t go on with Elspeth Huxley.&#x201d; His recollection continues:</p> <p>And so about three weeks later, at ten o&#x2019;clock at night there came a knock on our front door, and there was James [Ngugi]. He said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done something awful.&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;What can I do? How can I help?&#x201d; He said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve started writing a novel, and I&#x2019;ve got stuck! There it is.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d brought the manuscript with him, stacks of paper. I said, &#x201c;For goodness sake, come in.&#x201d;6</p> <p><i>The River Between</i> distills this atmosphere of urgency, self-questioning, and change into a beautifully compact and almost dystopian bildungsroman set in a vaguely fictional historical context around the time of the push by the British colonial religious infrastructure to eradicate female circumcision. At first its subject seems to be Waiyaki, a young boy who is supposed to mature into a beacon of hope and renewal for the Gikuyu community he inhabits as it processes its first encounter with the newly arrived white man, but really its subject is the tension surrounding this community as it confronts change.</p> <p>Writers have never been an easy lot. More than anyone&#x2014;except perhaps soldiers or mercenaries&#x2014;they thrive on conflict, viewing it as an integral part of any society. Ngugi is no exception. In fact, he is a master at placing conflict at the center of his narrative, almost at the expense of the characters who must live through it. In its account of a small community&#x2019;s interaction with imperial powers, <i>The River Between</i> offers us not the idea that there was peace before the white man and will be peace when Africa expels him, but the notion, however disturbing, that we owe this colonial conflict not resolution but understanding or even, if you will, respect.</p> <p><i>The River Between </i>begins like this:</p> <p>The two ridges lay side by side. One was Kameno, the other was Makuyu. Between them was a valley. It was called the valley of life. Behind Kameno and Makuyu were many more valleys and ridges, lying without any discernible plan. They were like many sleeping lions which never woke. They just slept, the big deep sleep of their Creator.</p> <p>This opening has long fascinated scholars because of its privileging of geography, place, and their mythological significance over characters as a narrative force. The novel starts slowly, almost frustratingly so, building tension in its imagery of opposition, of the ridges Kameno and Makuyu&#x2014;villages that we come to learn have competing philosophies&#x2014;as lions in extended slumber. What is so important about Ngugi&#x2019;s world is the suggestion that this tension predates colonialism. &#x201c;It began long ago,&#x201d; he writes, and we are introduced not to a precolonial utopia, unsophisticated in its social dynamics, but to a complex environment. Colonialism is not the start of history, nor will it be its end; it exacerbates existing tensions, embodied in an opening scene by a fight between two boys from different ridges: Kamau, the son of Kabonyi, the closest thing to the novel&#x2019;s villain, and Kinuthia, the fatherless youth who later serves as the voice of clarity for an increasingly isolated Waiyaki. It is a young Waiyaki who breaks up the fight, and in so doing establishes himself as the presence through which readers will access subsequent struggles in the narrative.</p> <p>Waiyaki is introduced as a typical hero. As a boy he is &#x201c;already tall for his age,&#x201d; with a &#x201c;well-built, athletic body&#x201d; and a scar from an errant goat. Most important, he has the right curiosity and bloodline. He role-plays the mythological heroes of the tribe while attending to his daily duties but gains real insight into his supposed purpose and the turmoil it will bring through his father, Chege, a weary prophet and elder statesman from the Kameno ridge. Chege is privy to secrets of the tribe&#x2014;the prophecy that the white man will come like butterflies, that the tribe will produce a savior to deal with him, and that this savior will come from his own lineage, a prominent bloodline that includes the seer Mugo wa Kibiro.</p> <p>The moment of revelation of the prophecy sets Waiyaki on a path of growth but also reveals more tension, the specter of Kabonyi, the opportunist who will later come to haunt Waiyaki and highlight intergenerational political tensions that are as much a problem as the arrival of colonizing forces. Hidden here in this moment is the fatal flaw passed from father to son, the belief that the upheaval created by the white man can be stilled by incorporating into daily life the white man&#x2019;s philosophy and using it against him. Waiyaki is told to &#x201c;Learn all the wisdom and all the secrets of the white man. But do not follow his vices,&#x201d; and later tries to establish education as the basis for the community&#x2019;s self-reconciliation and simultaneous salvation.</p> <p>More than anything else, it is the white man&#x2019;s religion, Christianity, that exacerbates existing tensions within the community. There are those who reject it, like Chege; those who see it as a tool to achieve status, like Kabonyi; and those who become fervent believers, like the fanatical Joshua, a preacher from Makuyu so enraptured by it that he would disown his children for existing outside his narrow interpretation of its tenets.</p> <p>We are not given a concrete reason for Joshua&#x2019;s conversion, told only that he is consumed by his devotion and disconnected from the geography of the tribes. Life for Joshua is complete&#x2014;except that it is not. The trouble with Joshua comes through in a description of his residence that demonstrates Ngugi&#x2019;s narrative brilliance:</p> <p>Joshua&#x2019;s house was different. His was a tin-roofed rectangular building standing quite distinctly by itself on the ridge. The tin roof was already decaying and let in rain freely, so on top of the roof could be seen little scraps of sacking that covered the very bad parts.</p> <p>The passage recalls the biblical parable of the man who built his house on sand. It does not take long for Joshua&#x2019;s reality to cave in on itself: His second daughter, Muthoni, ignores his prohibition against the &#x201c;sinful&#x201d; practice of female circumcision. Her embrace of the tribal initiation ceremony that will make her a woman and the resulting rupture in her home and community make gender a subject of major conflict in the novel.</p> <p>While not set at a particular time, <i>The River Between</i> maps loosely to the turmoil resulting from a 1929 decree by the Church of Scotland Mission prohibiting circumcised individuals from attending mission schools. The Church of Scotland Mission is represented in the novel by Reverend Livingstone, the sole white character given voice. Attending some of the dances on the eve of circumcision, he</p> <p>was horrified beyond measure. The songs he heard and the actions he saw convinced him beyond any doubt that these people were immoral through and through. He was thoroughly nauseated and he never went to another such dance. Circumcision had to be rooted out if there was to be any hope of salvation for these people.</p> <p>A wide swath of the community that Livingstone condemns stands in opposition to his thinking and finds a voice in the prophet Chege, who reflects: &#x201c;Circumcision was the central rite in the Gikuyu way of life. Who had ever heard of a girl that was not circumcised? Who would ever pay cows and goats for such a girl? Certainly it would never be his son. Waiyaki would never betray the tribe.&#x201d; Both female and male circumcision, as coming-of-age rites for the youth of Kameno and Mayku, play a central role in the novel, but it is female circumcision that is of greater consequence, because of its importance to the institution of marriage&#x2014;a means of wealth transfer in almost every social group. The Church of Scotland Mission&#x2019;s prohibition of circumcision amounted to a prohibition of tribal life and of the future itself.</p> <p>Jomo Kenyatta, the first leader of Kenya, tried to explain the controversy over female circumcision in his anthropological study of Gikuyu culture, <i>Facing Mount Kenya</i>:</p> <p>The real argument lies not in the defence of the surgical operation or its details, but in the understanding of a v...</p></p><h2>Miller &amp; Freund's Probability and Statistics for Engineers (8th Edition)</h2><p>This text is rich in exercises and examples, and explores both elementary probability and basic statistics, with an emphasis on engineering and science applications.

This book focuses on the reinventions and transformations of antiquity in the work of four culturally and politically diverse artists between 1905 and 1935. In distinctly different ways, classicizing creations such as de Chirico&#x2019;s enigmatic piazzas, Picasso&#x2019;s post-Cubist women, L�ger&#x2019;s mechanized nudes, and Picabia&#x2019;s Transparencies reflect what the eyes and minds of these artists found so arresting in the arts of antiquity and how they made those arts modern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>Classicism in the modern age has often been condemned as a conservative regression of the avant-garde in light of the totalitarian regimes that formed in Europe during this period. Yet far from being a reactionary language, the &#x201c;classical&#x201d; provided a range of elements that were surprisingly in tune with the &#x201c;modern.&#x201d; <i>Modern Antiquity</i> draws unprecedented attention not only to the aesthetic impact ancient art had on twentieth-century artists but also to the ways in which these artists shaped our contemporary experience of antiquity.

This edition is a condensed and updated version of the first edition, with an emphasis on current social issues in sport. It also has more global content. The golden triangle concept is more developed and applied more extensively. Other key themes of the first edition&#x2015;power, status, and inequality&#x2015;are also more developed. New "Stop and Think Questions" have been added to challenge students to think about the meaning of what they have read. The book is now divided into five sections. The new sections highlight sociology and the sociology of sport; inequality and diversity; globalization and social deviance; major social contexts of sport, including the high school, college, and professional levels; and power, political economy, and global sports.</p></p><p><b> </b><p><b>Howard L.

Bradford shows that PV electricity today has become the choice of hundreds of thousands of mainstream homeowners and businesses in many markets worldwide, including Japan, Germany, and the American Southwest. Solar energy will eventually be the cheapest source of energy in nearly all markets and locations because PV can bypass the aging and fragile electricity grid and deliver its power directly to the end user, fundamentally changing the underlying economics of energy. As the scale of PV production increases and costs continue to decline at historic rates, demand for PV electricity will outpace supply of systems for years to come. Ultimately, the shift from fossil fuels to solar energy will take place not because solar energy is better for the environment or energy security, or because of future government subsidies or as yet undeveloped technology. The solar revolution is already occurring through decisions made by self-interested energy users. The shift to solar energy is inevitable and will be as transformative as the last century's revolutions in information and communication technologies.</p></p><p>Travis Bradford is a Professor of Professional Practice at Columbia University and former head of the energy and environment graduate program at the School of International and Public Affairs.

However, it was these early stories that first earned her a reputation as a writer with "the liveliest imagination and most delicate style of her time." Influenced by Joyce, Proust, and the theories of William James, Bergson, and Freud, she strove to write a new fiction that emphasized the continuous flow of consciousness, time's passage as both a series of sequential moments and a longer flow of years and centuries, and the essential indefinability of character.<br>Readers can discover these and other aspects of her influential style in the eight stories collected here, among them a delightful, feminist put-down of the male intellect in "A Society" and a brilliant and sensitive portrayal of nature in "Kew Gardens." Also included are "An Unwritten Novel," "The String Quartet," "A Haunted House," "Blue &amp; Green," "The Mark on the Wall," and the title story.<br>In recent years, Woolf's fiction, feminism, and high-minded sensibilities have earned her an ever-growing audience of readers. This splendid collection offers those readers not only the inestimable pleasures of the stories themselves, but an excellent entr�e into the larger body of Woolf's work.</p><p>In recent years, Woolf&#39;s fiction, feminism and high-minded sensibilities have earned her an ever-growing audience of readers.

He was the first Anglo-American to travel overland to California via the Southwest, and he roamed through more of the West than anyone else of his era. His adventures quickly became the stuff of legend. Using new information and sifting fact from folklore, Barton H. Barbour now offers a fresh look at this dynamic figure.<p>Barbour tells how a youthful Smith was influenced by notable men who were his family&#x2019;s neighbors, including a member of the Lewis and Clark expedition. When he was twenty-three, hard times leavened with wanderlust set him on the road west. Barbour delves into Smith&#x2019;s journals to a greater extent than previous scholars and teases out compelling insights into the trader&#x2019;s itineraries and personality. Use of an important letter Smith wrote late in life deepens the author&#x2019;s perspective on the legendary trapper. Through Smith&#x2019;s own voice, this larger-than-life hero is shown to be a man concerned with business obligations and his comrades&#x2019; welfare, and even a person who yearned for his childhood. Barbour also takes a hard look at Smith&#x2019;s views of American Indians, Mexicans in California, and Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company competitors and evaluates his dealings with these groups in the fur trade.</p><p>Dozens of monuments commemorate Smith today. This readable book is another, giving modern readers new insight into the character and remarkable achievements of one of the West&#x2019;s most complex characters.</p></p><p><b>Barton H.

Too often public administration education has failed individuals who must deal with the hustle and bustle and complexity of policymaking. <i>Public Policy Praxis</i> equips students&nbsp;to grapple with ambiguity and complexity. By emphasizing mixed methodologies and through the use of cases, students are encouraged to develop a workable and practical model of applied policy analysis. </p> <p>Throughout the book, Clemons and McBeth argue that pragmatism demands that analysts learn to think politically and to understand that public problems are socially constructed. As such, in addition to analytical models, the authors examine specific tools of policy analysis, such as stakeholder mapping, content analysis, group facilitation, narrative analysis, cost-benefit analysis, futuring, and survey analysis. Students are given the opportunity to try out these analytical models and tools in varied case settings (county, city, federal, urban, and rural) facing wide-ranging topics (economic development, expansion of human services in an urban area, building a health care clinic in a small town, an inner-city drug program, and the bison controversy in Yellowstone National Park) that capture the diversity of public policy and the intergovernmental nature of politics.</p> <p>With chapters written to the student and in a nearly conversational style, <i>Public Policy Praxis</i> is an ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate courses in public policy analysis, community planning, leadership, social welfare policy, educational policy, family policy, and special seminars. </p></p><p><p><strong>Randy S.

The authors&#x2019; post-positivist perspective reflects current thinking within the discipline, and meshes perfectly with their case study approach. <i>Public Policy Praxis</i> remains accessible in tone as it challenges us to examine our most basic assumptions about the policy process."</strong> &#x2013;<i>Kenneth Kickham, University of Central Oklahoma, USA</i></p> <p><strong><em>"Public Policy Praxis</em> is a concise yet comprehensive guide to policy analysis combining the practical and theoretical in a balanced text. Both scholarly and conversational, it is a valuable resource offering a broad base of policy concepts and terminology, and providing the essential tools for meaningful policy dialogue and action on an evolving array of issues."</strong> <em>&#x2013;Bonnie Stabile, George Mason University, USA</em></p> <p><strong>"True to its name, <i>Public Policy Praxis</i> epitomizes the merger between diverse theories and meaningful practice. Now on their 3rd edition, Clemons and McBeth again deliver complex ideas and methods easily understood by policy students, yet substantive enough to belong on the scholar&#x2019;s bookshelf. The approach is practical, case driven, theoretically diverse, and yet simultaneously rigorous, covering complex tools of the trade&#x2015;both quantitative and qualitative. For a non-dogmatic, practical, and theoretically versatile policy analysis text, this is your book."</strong> &#x2013;<i>Michael Jones, Oregon State University, USA</i></p> <p><strong>"<em>Public Policy Praxis</em> is one of the best books available for graduate programs in applied public policy and policy analysis. It is an extremely well written piece of scholarship that seamlessly weaves both the theoretically important concepts in the field of public policy with the applied "toolkit" approach of policy analysis. Clemons and McBeth continue to provide both the scholar and the practitioner with an invaluable resource."</strong> &#x2013;<i>Gregory C. Hill, Boise State University, USA</i></p> <p><strong><em>"Public Policy Praxis</em> is a unique, case-based, and theory-rich approach for students to understand the politics of public policy and access tools of policy analysis.

In <strong>International Studies: Global Forces, Interactions, and Tensions</strong>, award-winning scholars Scott Straus and Barry Driscoll give you a clear framework that pinpoints how key factors&#x2015;forces, interactions, and tensions&#x2015;contribute to world events, with both global and local consequences.<br> <br> The authors first show you how to look for common patterns in global issues by introducing four world-shaping forces: global markets, shifting centers of power, information and communications technologies, and global governance. They systematically trace how these forces prompt interactions among world actors and thus give rise to a set of tensions that spur key challenges. The framework enables you to ask and answer for yourself&#x2015;Who is interacting? Where did such interactions develop? What policies or institutions govern them? Why are they getting certain global and local reactions?&nbsp;<br> <br> You are then apply the framework to the global problems that matter most to you: human rights abuses, economic inequality, terrorism, forced migration, pandemics and global health responses, climate change, food security, and more. <strong>International</strong> <strong>Studies </strong>raises the bar for the Introduction to IS course, moving beyond interdisciplinary, and into the realm of critical analysis to increase student relevancy and motivation.</p><p>"If you are looking for a text that incorporates two major aspects of teaching a course in International Studies, this is the book for you. There is coverage of the most important theoretical aspects of our highly globalized world so that students understand the impact of the ubiquitous technology on our interconnected lives. And there is coverage of the most important global issues of the day: terrorism, trade, aid, the environment, etc." Author: Cecilia Manrique<br><br>"I think the interactive and interdisciplinary approach will make this book stand out." Author: Bora Pajo<br><br>"This is a very good introduction to international affairs... well-organized, up-to-date, and lucid." Author: Brandon Kendhammer<br><br>"By approaching IR [IS] from an issues perspective, the authors have set themselves apart from competing texts.&nbsp; The inclusion of relatively recent issues is also an important factor setting this book apart." Author: Keith Hollinger<br><br>In short, Scott Straus and Barry Driscoll have ingeniously marshalled their intellectual forces to produce a memorable introductory text for international studies courses that should be required reading for anyone engaged with our globalizing, inter-connected, and interdependent world. In particular, it should sit atop the supplementary sources for all introductory liberal arts courses. Kudos to Straus and Driscoll for pulling off this scholarly and pedagogical feat! Author: Tarique Niazi PhD</p><h2>Hollywood Genres: Formulas, Filmmaking, and The Studio System</h2><p>The central thesis of this book is that a genre approach provides the most effective means for understanding, analyzing and appreciating the Hollywood cinema. Taking into account not only the formal and aesthetic aspects of feature filmmaking, but various other cultural aspects as well, the genre approach treats movie production as a dynamic process of exchange between the film industry and its audience. This process, embodied by the Hollywood studio system, has been sustained primarily through genres, those popular narrative formulas like the Western, musical and gangster film, which have dominated the screen arts throughout this century.</p><p></p><h2>The Intelligent Clinician&#39;s Guide to the DSM-5�</h2><p><em>The Intelligent Clinician's Guide to the DSM-5�</em> explores all revisions to the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual, and shows clinicians how they can best apply the strong points and shortcomings of psychiatry's most contentious resource. Written by a celebrated professor of psychiatry, this reader-friendly book uses evidence-based critiques and new research to point out where DSM-5 is right, where it is wrong, and where the jury's still out. Along the way, <em>The Intelligent Clinician's Guide to the DSM-5�</em> sifts through the many public controversies and clinical debates surrounding the drafting of the manual and shows how they inform a modern understanding of psychiatric illness, diagnosis and treatment. This book is necessary reading for all mental health professionals as they grapple with the first major revision of the DSM to appear in over 30 years.</p><p><br><strong>Joel Paris, MD</strong>, was born in New York City, but has spent most of his life in Canada. He obtained an MD from McGill University in 1964, where he also trained in psychiatry. Dr. Paris has been a member of the McGill psychiatry department since 1972 and served as Department Chair from 1997 to 2007. He has published 178 peer-reviewed articles, 14 books and 40 book chapters. He is Editor-in-Chief of the <em>Canadian Journal of Psychiatry</em>.<br><br>Dr Paris has written a wise and well informed book that will help readers understand and avoid the problems created by DSM 5. <br>Allen J. Frances, MD, Professor Emeritus, Department of Psychiatry, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC <br><p><br>Psychiatry's newest stage show (DSM-5) will draw a big audience, including health professionals, health organisations, lawyers and the general public. Joel Paris takes us 'back stage' . . . how can we appropriately classify and diagnose mental disorders, and the complexities of distinguishing a psychiatric 'case' from a 'non-case'. He details a flawed DSM-5 ideologically-based production but encourages us to recognise that while we have to use it, we can still work our way around it. He astutely observes that the DSM-5 editors know where Psychiatry is going and want to help us to get there more rapidly. . . . The book is a lucid, penetrating and perceptive 'must read' critique informing us the DSM-5 has no stronger a base in science than its immediate predecessors. We should all respect Paris' recommended antidote to its ideology - "apply extra caution and follow common sense." <br>Gordon Parker, Scientia Professor of Psychiatry, University of NSW, Sydney, Australia <br></p><p><br>The clinician who longs for a balanced, reliable, and illuminating assessment of the state of psychiatric diagnosis and what it all means for understanding our clients - and who yearns for a guide who understands all the technical details but has somehow miraculously retained his common sense - can do no better than to turn to Joel Paris's incisive, magisterial, tone-perfect, and clear-as-a-bell overview. . . . If I wanted to sit down with someone to talk over the background and meaning of psychiatric diagnosis as I will face it in the post-DSM-5 era, Joel Paris is the person I would talk to. This is the clinician's seatbelt for surviving the diagnostic turbulence that has been tossing us around over the past few years and, possibly, for years to come. <br>Jerome C. Wakefield, PhD, DSW, School of Social Work and Department of Psychiatry, New York University, New York and co-author of All We Have to Fear: Psychiatry's Transformation of Natural Anxieties into Mental Disorders<br></p><p><br>As referenced in The Globe and Mail, Toronto, April 27, 2013</p><p><br>From Sharon Jayson, USA Today, May 12, 2013: <br>"In his book, The Intelligent Clinician's Guide to the DSM-5, out last month, psychiatrist Joel Paris of McGill University in Montreal suggests that DSM has some pluses but a lot of minuses. 'The strong points would be that the manual does provide a useful guide to severe mental illness and it always has, ' he says. The closer that it gets to what people would consider normal behavior, the less useful the DSM is, he says." <br></p><p><br>"This is an excellent critique of DSM-5 and psychiatry in general. Written in an engaging style, the book draws readers in. Although it is less than 200 pages, it covers the complex changes in DSM-5 thoroughly and objectively In particular, it focuses on the DSM-5's conflation of normality and psychopathology and the reductionist view of psychiatry solely as neuroscience. The author challenges the DSM-5's use of categorical and dimensional organization without clinical input. He details why senior experts from DSM-III and DSM-IV were left out of the planning process for DSM-5 and what the editors of the DSM-5 were trying to achieve. All of this serves readers well in understanding the purpose of DSM-5 and being able to make an informed opinion about it. I highly recommend this book for anyone who will be using the DSM-5." <br>-- Brett C.

She tweets @EmilyHenryWrite.<p>1</p><p>The night before my last official day of high school, she comes back. I feel her in my room before I even open my eyes. That&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s always been.</p><p>&#x201c;Wake up, Natalie,&#x201d; she whispers, but she knows I&#x2019;m awake&#x2014;if a fly buzzed in the hallway, I&#x2019;d wake up&#x2014;just like she knows the drooling, snoring rug of a Saint Bernard at the foot of my bed, the <i>watchdog </i>Mom and Dad got to help me sleep better, will keep drooling and snoring through our entire conversation.</p><p>I open my eyes on darkness, push back the covers, and sit up. The crickets are thrumming outside my window, and the blue-green moonlight shines through the foliage across my carpet.</p><p>There she is, sitting in the rocking chair in the corner, as she has every time she&#x2019;s visited me since I was a little girl. Her ancient features are shrouded in night, her thick, gray-black hair loose down her shoulders. She wears the same ash-colored clothes as always, and though it&#x2019;s been nearly three years, she looks no older than the last time I saw her, or even the first time I saw her. If anything, she might look a little younger. Probably because <i>I&#x2019;m </i>older, and generally less terrified of wrinkles and age spots than I used to be.</p><p>I contemplate screaming&#x2014;twisting the knob on the bedside lamp, doing anything my eighteen years have taught me will make Them disappear, just to teach her a lesson for leaving me for so long, for letting me think she was finally gone for good.</p><p>But despite my bitterness, I don&#x2019;t want her to vanish, so I stay still.</p><p>&#x201c;Nice of you to stop by,&#x201d; I whisper. The words hurt my throat, which hasn&#x2019;t woken up yet. My vision&#x2019;s still settling too, piecing together the wrinkled details of her face, the laugh lines around her mouth, and the sweet crow&#x2019;s-feet at the corners of her dark eyes. &#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been right here,&#x201d; she says. It&#x2019;s one of her typical, cryptic answers.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been almost three years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not for me it hasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>Again&#x2014;for the thousandth time&#x2014;I survey her tattered shawl and the threadbare dress hanging on her bony body. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re outside of time, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Her right shoulder shifts in a shrug. &#x201c;Your words, not mine. Have any <i>others</i> come to see you?&#x201d;</p><p>I rub the heels of my hands over my eye sockets, stalling for time. I&#x2019;m ashamed to admit that no one&#x2019;s come and that I know exactly why. Though I want to be mad at her for abandoning me, it&#x2019;s my fault I haven&#x2019;t seen her in three years. <i>I </i>caused her disappearance. But it doesn&#x2019;t matter whether I admit it or not&#x2014;she already knows everything anyway. As if to prove that point, she says, &#x201c;I think Gus farted.&#x201d;</p><p>I lean over the bed and look down at the shaggy dog. His tongue is lolling in his sleep, and his perpetually oozing nose is busily sniffing. One of his back legs starts to kick in response to a dream, and the horrible smell she must&#x2019;ve been referring to hits me.</p><p>I cover my nose with my forearm. &#x201c;Ugh, <i>Gus</i>. You&#x2019;re a monster, and I love you, and you&#x2019;re disgusting.&#x201d;</p><p>I wait for the worst of the odor to pass before I answer her question. &#x201c;There haven&#x2019;t been others. They&#x2019;re all gone. Dr. Langdon thought the EMDR therapy worked. She said that&#x2019;s why you stopped coming. Apparently any trauma I had was resolved. I&#x2019;m a lucky girl. Or I was until five seconds ago.&#x201d;</p><p>EMDR: eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. It&#x2019;s a type of psychotherapy used to treat the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and, in my case, to shut out the woman in front of me and the various others who&#x2019;ve appeared at my bedside over the years.</p><p>She thinks for a moment. &#x201c;You know, just a moment ago&#x2014;a moment for me, that is, three years for you&#x2014;I told you something about Dr. Langdon. Did you pass it along?&#x201d;</p><p>I keep staring hard at her.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember what I told you, Natalie?&#x201d; she presses.</p><p>I nod once. &#x201c;You said she would die in a fire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s still alive,&#x201d; I supply. &#x201c;She also suggested I try Ativan<i>, </i>though of course Mom didn&#x2019;t approve. Apparently this is just a stressful time in a teenager&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;</p><p>God&#x2014;the private name I gave her years ago, though she insists I call her Grandmother&#x2014;laughs and looks down at her weathered hands, folded in her lap. &#x201c;Girl, you have no idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Were you ever my age?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>Her thick eyebrows rise up over her cloudy dark eyes. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she says quietly.</p><p>&#x201c;And it was stressful?&#x201d;</p><p>She jams her mouth shut. &#x201c;When I was your age, I knew nothing. Nothing about myself, nothing about the universe or about heartbreak. I remember being terrified to grow up, afraid of losing my friends, sure I&#x2019;d lose my mind. Life felt like a blender that wanted to eat me. But the things that happened to me when I was just a little bit older than you are&#x2014;those things made the blender feeling seem like a bubble bath.&#x201d;</p><p>I look down at the tear in my quilt. Mom made this blanket from a pattern while my birth mother was pregnant with me. It was going to belong to a different baby, from an adoption that fell through. Instead, it became mine when I became my parents&#x2019;. &#x201c;I missed you,&#x201d; I tell Grandmother.</p><p>&#x201c;I missed you too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you said it was only a minute for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was.&#x201d;</p><p>For a while we&#x2019;re both silent, staring at one another. Then she asks, &#x201c;How are the twins?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;Coco&#x2019;s transferring to a performing arts high school next year. Jack&#x2019;s still playing football. Mom&#x2019;s <i>so proud</i> of us all that she&#x2019;s liable to explode any day now, so that&#x2019;s good. At the end of summer she and Dad are taking us to San Francisco then up to Seattle.&#x201d; The trip is a tradition they&#x2019;ve had since they got married. Mom had never really traveled anywhere before, and her only reservation about marrying Dad was that she knew he loved Kentucky so much he&#x2019;d never leave. They were poor then, but Dad still promised they&#x2019;d see the world, or, at the very least, the continental U.S. Thus the annual Cleary Family Road Trip was born.</p><p>Grandmother closes her eyes for a long moment, and their corners crinkle prettily when they open. &#x201c;I thought this year was Boulder down through Denver and into Mesa Verde,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Jack gets food poisoning, and Coco won&#x2019;t eat anywhere that&#x2019;s not a chain after that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was last year,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;This year it&#x2019;s all Highway 101. Probably a good time to buy stock in Dramamine, if you&#x2019;re looking for a hot tip.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you? How are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m great. Moving to Rhode Island in August, to go to Brown&#x2014;but you probably already knew that.&#x201d;</p><p>She nods, and again we fall into stillness and silence. I&#x2019;ve missed this feeling, of sitting awake at night with her while the rest of the world dreams. The last three years have felt chaotic without these moments of quiet.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it true that God leaves you when you grow up?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;Is that why I haven&#x2019;t seen you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never said I was God.&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s true&#x2014;she&#x2019;s avoided the question of <i>what</i> exactly she is since she first appeared when I was six, and not for lack of my asking, guessing, and hypothesizing.</p><p>Before Grandmother, the hallucinations had all been terrifying: black orbs floating a foot over my nose, grizzled men in green jackets with eyes like endless pits, women painted like clowns posing at my bedside. When they came, I&#x2019;d scream, reach for the light, but by the time my parents came running to my bedroom door, the things would be gone, evaporated into the walls as though they&#x2019;d never come at all.</p><p>&#x201c;It was just a nightmare,&#x201d; Mom would assure me, running her long fingers through the tangles in my hair. Then Dad would get blankets from the hall closet and make a nest on the floor beside their bed, and I&#x2019;d finish the night in their room.</p><p>But when Grandmother appeared beside me that first time in the dead of night, things felt different. It&#x2019;s not like I had an extensive vocabulary for the spiritual or metaphysical&#x2014;my family is the &#x201c;church twice a year&#x201d; type, and those biannual visits have never done anything for me&#x2014;but I also never had any aversion to the concept of God Itself, just to the idea that we could possibly nail down all Its details.</p><p>God is a thing I think I see in glimmers all over: an enormous and vague warmth I sometimes catch pulsing around me, giving me shivers and making tears prick my eyes; a mysterious and limitless Thing threaded through all the world and refusing to be reduced to a name or a set of rules and instead winding itself through millions of stories, true and made up, connecting all breathing things.</p><p>And I&#x2019;d given Grandmother that nickname not because I thought she <i>was</i> that Thing but because I saw It in her, and knew she belonged to It. I had no other word at my disposal that could encompass a being who came out of the walls to protect me from the dark.</p><p>While <i>The Shining</i>-esque visitations hadn&#x2019;t been enough to make my parents take me to a shrink, an elderly American Indian celestial being showing up to tell me creation stories had. When I&#x2019;d mentioned <i>Grandmother</i> over breakfast, Mom immediately left the kitchen to call Dad. It was obvious I&#x2019;d done something wrong&#x2014;I just didn&#x2019;t know <i>what</i> until a week later, when Mom got home from her meet-and-greet with a child psychologist and had her first <i>talk</i> with me.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only natural to wonder about your heritage, honey,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, voice shaking. It sounded like a line from one of the <i>You Were a Special Gift</i> books she read to me as a toddler, in lieu of the more devastating &#x201c;You&#x2019;re adopted&#x201d; speech some other kids I knew got later. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay to explore your identity.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My eyes were open,&#x201d; I told her then. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t dreaming. Grandmother&#x2019;s real.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t convince Mom or Dad or Dr. Langdon, but I still knew: Grandmother was real. And she may have never admitted to being God, but I knew she was something, or a part of something, sublime.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;the Great Spirit, the Above Old Man, the Earth Maker, or Holitopa Ishki, or whatever exactly you are or call yourself&#x2014;just answer the question. Are you going to leave me now that I&#x2019;m an adult or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever it is I am?&#x201d;</p><p>Grandmother&#x2019;s mouth tightens. She stands, and my heart starts to pound&#x2014;she&#x2019;s never stood before, in all the dozens of nights she&#x2019;s come to me. She crosses the room, perches on the edge of my bed, and takes my hands in hers. Her skin is impossibly soft, like velvet, like powdered sediments or antique silk.</p><p>&#x201c;This,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;may be the last time you&#x2019;ll see me, Natalie. But I&#x2019;ll <i>always</i> be with you.&#x201d;</p><p>I blink back tears and shake my head. My oldest friend in the world, someone who doesn&#x2019;t exist according to all the experts, who is only and fully mine. It shouldn&#x2019;t be much of a surprise. I&#x2019;m leaving for Brown in three months. Soon, that rocking chair, this bedroom, the rolling blue hills of Kentucky will all be things of the past. Did I really think she&#x2019;d come with me? Still, I hear myself ask her, &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>She smooths my hair back from my forehead, the same way Mom always does. &#x201c;Lie down, girl. I&#x2019;m going to tell you one last story, and I want you to listen well. It&#x2019;s important.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s always important.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It <i>is</i> always important.&#x201d; She returns to the rocking chair, stopping to scratch behind Gus&#x2019;s ear when he lets out an unconscious whimper. She sits and clears her throat. &#x201c;This is the story of the beginning of the world, and the woman who fell from the sky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard that one before,&#x201d; I remind her. &#x201c;Actually, I&#x2019;m pretty sure it was the first story you ever told me.&#x201d;</p><p>She nods. &#x201c;It was the first, and so it&#x2019;ll be the last, because now you&#x2019;ve learned to listen.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Learn to listen, listen with your bones, let the story fill you</i>. Things she&#x2019;s always saying. Honestly, I have next to no clue what she&#x2019;s talking about, partly because I only ever see her in the middle of the night when my brain&#x2019;s full of fog, and partly because her voice is the phonic equivalent of a music box playing &#x201c;Clair de Lune,&#x201d; so soothing that the words get lost in the blanket of the sound. I lie back and close my eyes, letting that voice wash over me now.</p><p>&#x201c;There was an old world that came before ours,&#x201d; she begins, &#x201c;a world that had never before seen death. And in that world there was a young woman who was very strong and very strange. The woman&#x2019;s father was the first person to die in the world, and even after he did, she would speak with his spirit often. Death had opened her father&#x2019;s eyes to all sorts of secrets the woman could not yet see, and because of this, his spirit told her to marry a stranger in a distant land whom he had chosen for her. So against her mother&#x2019;s wishes, the young woman trusted her father&#x2019;s spirit and journeyed to that distant land and presented herself to the stranger. This man was a powerful sorcerer, and he received the woman&#x2019;s marriage proposal skeptically, since she was still very young and he would need a wife with strength and resolve. He decided that he would give her three tests, and if she should pass, then he would marry her.</p><p>&#x201c;First, he took her into his lodge and gave her corn. &#x2018;Grind this corn,&#x2019; he told her. And she took it and barely boiled it, and though there were many mounds of it, she ground it against the stone very quickly, and the sorcerer was amazed.</p><p>&#x201c;For the second test, he ordered her to take off her clothing and to cook the corn over the fire. As she did, it popped and splattered on her, the mush burning her skin where it landed, but she didn&#x2019;t flinch. She stood, unmoving, as the corn burned her until the mush was finished.</p><p>&#x201c;For her final test, the sorcerer opened the door to his lodge and called to his beast servants, who came running, and he invited them to eat the mush from off her bare skin. And though their sharp teeth and tongues sliced and cut and repulsed her, she still remained serene and steadfast. So the sorcerer agreed to marry her.</p><p>&#x201c;For four nights, the wed couple slept with the soles of their feet touching, and then the husband sent his wife back to her village with a great gift of meat for all her kin. He told her to divide it evenly among all the people in the village. He also told her that they should peel back their roofs so that he could bless them with a rain of white corn that night, and so she did, and it was so.</p><p>&#x201c;When she returned, his lodge became her home too, and she began to spend her days with one particular tree that grew there. It was a tree with blossoms made of light so bright that they illuminated all of his land. The woman loved the tree&#x2014;it made her feel less strange, less out of place&#x2014;and she would sit under it and talk with all the spirits and with her dead father too. She loved it so much that once, late at night when everyone was sleeping, she went out and lay with it and became pregnant.</p><p>&#x201c;Around that time, her husband grew sick, and none of the medicine people could heal him, but they all told him that the illness had been caused by his wife. He knew they were right; he&#x2019;d never met a person as powerful as her. He asked them what he should do. Divorce didn&#x2019;t exist there. The only death that had occurred was her father&#x2019;s, and no one yet understood it. But the medicine people were wise, and they found a solution.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Uproot the light tree,&#x2019; they told him, &#x2018;and call her...</p></p><h2>Merge Left: Fusing Race and Class, Winning Elections, and Saving America</h2><p><p><strong>From the acclaimed author of <em>Dog Whistle Politics</em>, an essential road map to neutralizing the role of racism as a divide-and-conquer political weapon and to building a broad multiracial progressive future</strong></p> <p><strong>"Ian Haney L�pez has broken the code on the racial politics of the last fifty years."&#x2014;Bill Moyers</strong></p> <p>In 2014, Ian Haney L�pez in <em>Dog Whistle Politics</em> named and explained the coded racial appeals exploited by right-wing politicians over the last half century&#x2014;and thereby anticipated the 2016 presidential election. Now the country is heading into what will surely be one of the most consequential elections ever, with the Right gearing up to exploit racial fear-mongering to divide and distract, and the Left splintered over the next step forward. Some want to focus on racial justice head-on; others insist that a race-silent focus on class avoids alienating white voters.</p> <p>Can either approach&#x2014;race-forward or colorblind&#x2014;build the progressive supermajorities necessary to break political gridlock and fundamentally change the country&#x2019;s direction?</p> <p>For the past two years, Haney L�pez has been collaborating with a research team of union activists, racial justice leaders, communications specialists, and pollsters. Based on conversations, interviews, and surveys with thousands of people all over the country, the team found a way forward.</p> <p>By merging the fights for racial justice and for shared economic prosperity, they were able to build greater enthusiasm for both goals&#x2014;and for the cross-racial solidarity needed to win elections. What does this mean? It means that neutralizing the Right&#x2019;s political strategy of racial division is possible, today. And that&#x2019;s the key to everything progressives want to achieve.</p> <p>A work of deep research, nuanced argument, and urgent insight, <em>Merge Left: Fusing Race and Class, Winning Elections, and Saving America</em> is an indispensable tool for the upcoming political season and in the larger fight to build racial justice and shared economic prosperity for all of us.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Ian Haney L�pez</strong> is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he teaches in the areas of race and constitutional law. Haney L�pez is the author of&nbsp;<em>Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class</em>, plus two other books and two anthologies.

Haney L�pez shows why the path to a truly just society lies in a multi-racial coalition of poor, working and middle-class Americans. . . . Powerful, urgent, and timely.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Robert B. Reich, former labor secretary and Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor, University of California at Berkeley</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Understanding how to counteract the conservative playbook on race . . . is the great challenge of political strategy today. It has also been the determined, prescient and indispensably productive pursuit of Ian Haney L�pez for decades.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Rashad Robinson, president, <em>Color Of Change</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Cross-racial solidarity is the Holy Grail of progressive politics. <em>Merge Left</em> makes the best case yet for how to finally achieve it as the route to racial and economic justice.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Heather McGhee, distinguished senior fellow, Demos and Demos Action</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Read <em>Merge Left</em>. The unity that makes the labor movement unbeatable requires genuine cross-racial solidarity.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Richard Trumka, president, AFL-CIO</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Merge Left</em> explains the tools we need to highlight how racism is used to drive working families apart. Now, we have a frame to take race head-on in politics and in our journey to build power for working people.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Mary Kay Henry, international president, SEIU</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Merge Left</em> should be read by every person who strives for a sane and humane immigration policy&#x2014;and a flourishing democracy for all of us.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Mar�a Teresa Kumar, president, Voto Latino</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In <em>Dog Whistle Politics</em>, Haney L�pez explained how coded racism in politics tears us apart.

Ian Haney L�pez&#x2019;s <em>Dog Whistle Politics</em> called out how coded language used by right-wing politicians kept the White electorate focused on race and distracted from the economic issues plaguing Whites and people of color. His new book,&nbsp;<em>Merge Left</em>,&nbsp;uses research and focus group results to make it clear that transformative solidarity is real and we can make it happen. To all believers, the hopeful and others, please read it now.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Angela Glover-Blackwell, founder, PolicyLink</strong><br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been working to change the political system for years. I have believed that what is needed is a movement strong enough to unite both people of color and white working-class people. I have scratched my head about how best to frame this. Then <em>Merge Left</em> arrived. Finally, we have the how-to manual for dismantling a system of division that hurts everyone. <em>Merge Left</em> is the book for anyone interested in cross-racial solidarity on behalf of racial and economic justice for all!&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Jane Fonda</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Racism is a weapon against the working class and cross-racial solidarity is the linchpin to creating an energized and empowered movement for restaurant workers and beyond. <em>Merge Left</em> explores a powerful strategy and path forward where working people and families can win&#x2014;not just in the next election, but into the future.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Saru Jayaraman, president, Restaurant Opportunities Centers United</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Merge Left</em> makes clear that major progress on racial justice will follow from defeating dog whistle politics once and for all. For all of us seeking to end state violence against communities of color, this book is powerful, timely, trenchant, and practical.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Kimberl� Crenshaw, executive director, African American Policy Forum, and faculty director, Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies, Columbia University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Merge Left</em> is the essential handbook for everyone who is standing up to xenophobia and fighting for humane immigration policies. And it is so much more than that. <em>Merge Left</em> is for every activist and progressive committed to building a broad, diverse and dynamic movement that actually delivers on the promise of both racial and economic justice.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Frank Sharry, executive director, America&#x2019;s Voice</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Solidarity is the crucial ingredient in the fight against the ever-more-dangerous plutocracy.

Although it has had its critics, the fact that it continues to be the most long lived text for courses in international relations attests to its enduring value. Someone has said the study of international relations has for half a century been nothing so much as a dialogue between Morgenthau, those who embrace his approach, and those who turn elsewhere for enlightenment. After 50 years, the dialogue between Morgenthau and scholars from around the world continues more or less as in the past something with more intensity even in an "age of terror."<br> The new edition preserves intact Morgenthau's original work while adding a 40 page introduction by the editors who explore its relevance for a new era. What follows the introduction are the perspectives of a dozen statesmen, scholars, and observers each offering insights on Morgenthau's concepts and ideas as they relate to current crises on every continent. They bring up to date the dialogue that began in 1948.</p><p></p><h2>The Brightwork Companion : Tried-and-True Methods and Strongly Held Opinions in Thirteen and One-Half Chapters</h2><p><p><b>A hands-on handbook for the do-it-yourself refinisher</b></p> <p>From the author of the revered classic <i>Brightwork: The Art of Finishing Wood </i>comes this lifeline for the weekend warrior with a brush, a can of varnish, and two days to show results.

Of a road trip in a wood-paneled station wagon, with the kids in the way-back, singing along to the Steve Miller Band. Of brothers waking up early on Saturday mornings for five consecutive hours of cartoons. Of growing up in a magical era populated by Bic pens, Mr. Clean and Scrubbing Bubbles, lightsabers and those oh-so-coveted Schwinn Sting-Ray bikes. And of a father--one of 3M's greatest and last eight-track salesmen--traveling across the country on the brand-new Boeing 747, providing for his family but wanting nothing more than to get home. In <em>Sting-Ray Afternoons</em>, Steve Rushin paints an utterly nostalgic, psychedelically vibrant portrait of a decade overflowing with technological evolution, cultural revolution, as well as brotherly, sisterly, and parental love. <br><br></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2017:</strong> I am a child of the 70s, and for me, the years before I became burdened with job/girls/nuclear holocaust-based insomnia were filled with <em>The Six-Million Dollar Man</em>, Evel Knievel, baseball cards, and <em>Gilligan&#x2019;s Island</em> reruns, all set to a soundtrack featuring both Led Zeppelin and the soulless, sexless croonings of the Brothers Gibb. </p> If you can relate to any or all of that last paragraph (and it&#x2019;s perfectly understandable if you can&#x2019;t) imagine it extended to over 300 pages. <em>Sting-Ray Afternoons </em>- Steve Rushin&#x2019;s memoir of the Golden Age of candy cigarettes, sugar on your grapefruit, and Nixon on the TV - is an exhaustively thorough, exuberant recollection of growing up in the Me Decade. Exhaustive might have been just exhausting, but Rushin&#x2019;s takes on artificially colored culture are laced equally with humor and affection, and he captures both the wonder and fear at the tipping point between childhood and adolescence. <em>Sting-Ray Afternoons</em> is the best kind of nostalgia: celebratory yet clear-eyed, wistful but not overly sentimental. <em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em>Steve Rushin is a writer for <i>Sports Illustrated </i>and the 2006 National Sportswriter of the Year.

He has been visiting associate professor of drawing at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, since 2004 and has taught at the Art Students League of New York since 2005.Foreword<br> I won an out-of-town scholarship to the Art Students League in 1955 and stayed at the YMCA for 79 cents a night if I made my own bed. Stewart Klonis was the president of the Art Students League at the time, and Rosina Florio was the registrar. She said when I arrived I jumped up on her desk and said, &#x201c;Hurray!&#x201d;<br><br> I studied with Robert Beverly Hale, George Grosz, Vaclav Vytlacil, Edwin Dickinson, Sidney Dickinson, Morris Kantor, Will Barnet, and all the old-timers. The school was all about drawing and composition. My previous teacher, Cameron Booth, who had taught at the Art Students League and taught me at the University of Minnesota, excelled in both and gave me a good grounding before I arrived in New York City.<br><br> New York was intimidating. I walked everywhere and never took the subway. The museums were free, empty, and like sanitariums; today they are packed. I would see Marlon Brando and Wally Cox having coffee at the MoMA coffee shop. Life was free and casual. I applied myself and attended night classes at the Art Students League until I caught pneumonia and went to the Roosevelt Hospital Welfare Ward. I had a close artist friend, Ray Donarski, who lent me his last 5 dollars after he borrowed 10 dollars from painter Henry Pearson. Life was precarious but interesting.<br><br> My fellow students were Ray Donarski, Takeshi Asada, Chuck Hinman, and Lee Bontecou. The art world was small&#x2014;57th Street, 10th Street, 23rd Street&#x2014;with few galleries and few museum shows. Besides making art, my energies were directed to finding new lofts or apartments and getting enough to eat. My friends and I would do eating combines; we would chip in 50 cents and make huge meals. All you could eat. Also we would keep cheap apartments and pass them along as much as possible&#x2014;the rents were 23 dollars a month. It was our underground. I would continue to go to free art classes at the Art Students League and continue to draw. A friend told me about a great job with the Stearns family in Irvington, New York. I went to see them, and Joyce Stearns jumped out the front door and said, &#x201c;Hop in my Wildcat and I&#x2019;ll show you the castle.&#x201d; We were fixed a lunch, and Joyce said, &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; The job was to watch the children and chauffeur the family. I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take it.&#x201d; Tending bar for the Stearns in 1956 I met Romare Bearden and John Chamberlain. And I later became friends with both of them.<br><br> The Art Students League showed me that methods are simple but the results can be incredible. All the paintings in museums around the world are merely minerals mixed mostly in oil, smeared on cloth by the hairs from the back of a pig&#x2019;s ear (a Chinese bristle brush). And all the famous drawings in most museums are done merely with burnt wood (charcoal) drawn on parchment. With these basic materials you can do most anything. <br> The seriousness of the teaching at the Art Students League had an impact and helped me use my materials to explore the fantastic.<br> &#x2014;James Rosenquist, artist and former Art Students League student<br> Preface<br> Whether civilization gave birth to art or art to civilization, the two are inseparable. From the first time images were made on the walls of caves going back forty millennia, there has been an enduring enchantment with the art of painting and our ability to interpret what we see&#x2014;which in turn deepens our understanding of nature and the nature of being human. Along with survival, communication is our strongest imperative, and that ongoing drive has given birth to the creation of different forms of language to bring clarity to what we perceive. Painting conveys perceptions that words cannot. We continue to be inspired by the likes of Rembrandt, Poussin, Titian, Vel�zquez, Rubens, Vermeer, Ingres, Corot, C�zanne, Picasso, Matisse, O&#x2019;Keeffe, de Kooning, and so many more whose art endures today and will speak to generations to come. As one creates a picture from observation there is an awareness and a palpable sensation of being connected to the world we are observing. At first, we&#x2019;re fascinated that through the application of viscous colored material to a blank surface, we can make a picture appear like what we&#x2019;re seeing. That&#x2019;s when the journey begins. As when we learned to speak or even to walk, the beginnings <br> are clumsy. The idea of &#x201c;painting what we see&#x201d; steers our thinking well before we learn <br> to understand how to see. The language of visual art is as complex as any other, with intrinsic grammar and vocabulary that take many years of commitment, discipline, and guidance to master.<br> After time, the brush becomes an extension of one&#x2019;s hand. Intuition relieves the brain of overthinking and overanalysis. Seeing becomes perceiving. Subject matter is form, color, and space animated by a face, figure, landscape, or still life, or it can be without any literal reference. There is artistry in each paint stroke as the brush makes its way across the surface, like a signature with no name, just indications of cognizance spoken with color.<br> At the Art Students League of New York, more classes are devoted to painting than to any other discipline. As the League has grown with the times, so has the number of approaches to the medium. The language of art has many dialects, and we initially choose what suits our temperament. Whether academic realism, chiaroscuro, expressionism, or abstraction, the means of communicating with paint are endless, and the creation of art&#x2014;to both painter and viewer&#x2014;remains as significant today as it has been since before the dawn of recorded history.<br> &#x2014;Ira Goldberg, executive director, Art Students League of New York</p><h2>Future 2: English for Results (with Practice Plus CD-ROM)</h2><p><em><strong>Note: This is Standalone book and does not include Workbook. <br>For Studentbook with Workbook package buy ISBN</strong><strong> 0132455846</strong></em> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em> <strong> <em>Future's </em> </strong> </em>research-based, comprehensive curriculum empowers learners with the academic, workplace, and media literacy skills they need to get ahead.</p> <ul> <li> <strong> <em> <strong>Future </strong> </em> </strong> <strong>prepares students with 21st century skills,</strong> helping them transition to further education or career training. </li> <li>Student book with <strong>Interactive Practice Plus CD-ROM </strong>enables learners to persist by providing multiple pathways to learning. </li> <li>Built-in <strong>multilevel instruction</strong> ensures the success of every student.</li> </ul> <p>Components include:</p> <ul> <li>Student Book with Practice Plus CD-ROM </li> <li>Workbook with Audio CD </li> <li>Audio Program </li> <li>Tests and Test Prep with ExamView </li> <li>Teacher's Edition&nbsp;and Lesson Planner </li> <li>Multilevel Communicative Activities Book (Reproducibles) </li> <li>Transparencies and Reproducible Vocabulary Cards </li> <li>Professional Development DVD</li> </ul> <p>The <strong>Practice Plus CD-ROM</strong> included with the Student Book is an extraordinary tool for individualizing instruction.

His primary belief in the classroom&#x2015;and hence the material in this textbook&#x2015;is that the development of a mathematical is central to the analysis and design of an engineering system or process. His text is therefore oriented toward teaching students how to develop mathematical representations of physical phenomena.</p><p>Great effort has been put forth to provide many examples of experimental data against which the results of modeling exercises can be compared and to expose students to the wide range of technologies of interest to chemical, environmental and bio engineering students.</p><p>Examples presented are motivated by real engineering applications and may of the problems are derived from the author's years of experience as a consultant to companies whose businesses cover a broad spectrum of engineering technologies.</p></p><p>Designed for undergraduate and graduate level engineering courses, this authoritative text helps students to significantly expand their knowledge of heat and mass transfer. At its heart is a belief in the need for each student to develop and evaluate mathematical models based on numerous examples of experimental data. In the process, the author provides valuable exposure to the broad spectrum of engineering applications. A confidence-building volume that both teaches and challenges students.For a Full Course on Transport Phenomena A companion text entitled An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics, written by the same author, is also available. Together, these two texts represent complete, consistent coverage of transport phenomena. Both texts: <ul> <li>Focus on the development of a mathematical model as a central part of the analysis and design of an engineering system or process</li> <li>Teach students how to develop accurate mathematical representations of physical phenomena</li> <li>Present many examples of experimental data against which the model can be compared</li> <li>Expose students to the wide range of technologies which they may encounter in the future</li> <li>Provide a wealth of real world applications drawn from the author's years of experience as a consultant</li> </ul></p><h2>Generalized Linear Models (Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability)</h2><p>The success of the first edition of <strong>Generalized Linear Models</strong> led to the updated Second Edition, which continues to provide a definitive unified, treatment of methods for the analysis of diverse types of data. Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of content and direct relevance to agricultural, biological, health, engineering, and other applications.<br><br>The authors focus on examining the way a response variable depends on a combination of explanatory variables, treatment, and classification variables. They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables.<br><br>The <strong>Second Edition</strong> includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions.<br><br>Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained.

H. Lawrence wrote, &#x201c;Nathaniel knew disagreeable things in his inner soul. He was careful to send them out in disguise.&#x201d; By means of artfully crafted and compelling tales, Hawthorne explored the destinies and concerns of early American settlers and citizens. In several of the stories in this collection, characters who hold themselves apart from their fellow man fall prey to the corroding desires of lust for perfection. Then they unwittingly commit evils&#x2014;against themselves and others&#x2014;in the name of pride. Edgar Allan Poe noted of Hawthorne&#x2019;s writing: &#x201c;Every word tells, and there is not a word which does not tell.&#x201d;</p><p>Nathaniel Hawthorne was born on July 4, 1804, in Salem, Massachusetts, the son and grandson of proud New England seafarers. He lived in genteel poverty with his widowed mother and two young sisters in a house filled with Puritan ideals and family pride in a prosperous past. His boyhood was, in most respects, pleasant and normal. In 1825 he was graduated from Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, and he returned to Salem determined to become a writer of short stories. For the next twelve years he was plagued with unhappiness and self-doubts as he struggled to master his craft. He finally secured some small measure of success with the publication of his <i>Twice-Told Tales</i> (1837). His marriage to Sophia Peabody in 1842 was a happy one. <i>The Scarlet Letter </i>(1850), which brought him immediate recognition, was followed by <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i> (1851). After serving four years as the American Consul in Liverpool, England, he traveled in Italy; he returned home to Massachusetts in 1860. Depressed, weary of writing, and failing in health, he died on May 19, 1864, at Plymouth, New Hampshire.<br><p>Ross C.

Based on more than 5000 plant specimens collected by the authors in a decade of hiking that totalled more than 5400 miles, this guide covers all the common native species, and many of the rare ones, that grow not only in the forests but also in the high-mountain meadows, on heath balds, in long-abandoned fields, and along fence rows and roadsides. In addition to the plant descriptions, the guide contains illustrated keys to both summer and winter traits - that is, twigs, bark, and winter buds, as well as leaves - so that readers can collect and identify specimens at any time of year. From the birch and alder, to the oak and Carolina silverbell, from the mountain-laurel and American holly, to the mountain pepperbush, chokeberry, buffalo nut and yellowroot, the trees, shrubs and woody vines described here include many plants unique to the southern mountains as well as those found elsewhere in eastern North America.

The first looked a lot like Hollywood, full of beautiful people, sunlight, and freeways. The second looked more like <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>&#x2015;a nightmare landscape filled with impoverished people, broken-down cars, barren landscapes, and broken dreams. This book chronicles Shing's solo journey (small adventure-dog included) along the iconic Route 66, beginning in Santa Monica and ending up Chicago. What begins as a road trip ends up as something more like a pilgrimage in search of an American landscape that seems forever shifting and forever out of place. </p></p><p><b>Shing Yin Khor </b>is a cartoonist and installation artist. Her work has been published in <i>The Toast</i>, <i>The Nib</i>, <i>Upworthy</i>, <i>Huffington Post</i>, and <i>Bitch Magazine</i>.

She is also the author of <i>The American Dream? A Journey on Route 66 Discovering Dinosaur Statues</i>, <i>Muffler Men</i>, and the <i>Perfect Breakfast Burrito</i> published by Zest Books. She lives in Los Angeles.<p>"Malaysian-born, LA-dwelling Khor introduces the 'two Americas' that were their obsessions growing up: a Los Angeles 'full of beautiful people and sunlight and open roads' where 10 years of living has also added 'lots and lots and lots of traffic,' and a landscape defined by Steinbeck's <em>Grapes of Wrath</em>, in which the Joad family desperately pursues the American Dream. <strong>Khor takes that 'feeling of desperately searching for something better, for a new start,' and adapts it to their own 'pilgrimage' as immigrant and artist traveling historic Route 66</strong>&#x2015;'the part of America that my brain finds more American than anything else.' Traversing from LA to Chicago in their 2010 Honda Fit will require their 'tiny adventure dog,' Bug, and the kindness of multiple friends and strangers en route, captured <strong>in whimsical full-color detail.</strong> The end-of-the-road realizations are (surprise!) not what they expected, but the rewards&#x2015;of course!&#x2015;are many. What lingers longest is Khor's four-panel epilogue, revealing their trip was taken six months before the 2016 elections; in magnifier-necessary micro-font, the penultimate panel confesses, 'This comic feels like a record of a time when a brown girl could drive America fearlessly.' Khor, with Bug's support, refuses to 'let those jerks keep us down,' encouragement to all to also keep going."&#x2015;starred, <em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"A lovely, deceptively simple road trip memoir that revels in quirky discovery and quiet adventure while grappling with the anger and longing of one immigrant's experience."&#x2015;Greg Pak, Comic Book Writer</p> (<i>Other Print</i>)<br><br><p>"Artist Khor recounts their spring 2016 road trip from Los Angeles to Chicago in this graphic memoir. Growing up in Malaysia, Khor knew two versions of America: 'The first was Los Angeles, full of beautiful people and sunlight and open roads,' and the other was the America in Steinbeck's <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>, 'filled with dusty roads and big hopes.' After living in the States for 10 years, they and Bug, their 'tiny adventure dog,' embark on a journey along historic Route 66, hoping to better understand the American dream. Through bright, expressive watercolor illustrations, Khor portrays the memorable locations they pass through, including a former gold-mining town in Arizona where several Hollywood films were shot; Amarillo, Texas, which has become a haven for refugees; and kitschy attractions including dinosaur statues and the Blue Whale of Catoosa. They detail both the amusing (going to the bathroom outdoors) and emotional (loneliness and exhaustion) challenges of being a traveler. Khor's pilgrimage is as much an exploration of themself as it is of nostalgic Americana. Their travels inspire them to share insights into their path to atheism, their anger with xenophobia and racism&#x2015;which are provoked when they find a motel labeled 'American owned'&#x2015;and the meaning of 'home.'

In this graphic memoir, they record their journey along the historic Route 66 to learn more about America, trying to understand how, as an immigrant, they fit in. Vivid watercolors and a thoughtful narrative bring each stop to life, cataloging quirky Americana, interesting people, and the remains of towns that disappeared as travelers deserted Route 66 for more modern highways. The art is warm and vibrant and, when depicting open vistas and night skies, breathtaking. The writing turns introspective as Khor discusses their impressions as an immigrant and person of color. They feel rejected when they see the 'American owned' signs (code for 'not South Asian') on motels in New Mexico, embraced when they finds a strong immigrant community in Texas, and conflicted at how Native American culture has been promoted through commercialization.

Includes full chapters on basic logical concepts, the uses of language, definitions, fallacies, categorical propositions, categorical syllogisms, arguments in ordinary language, symbolic logic, methods of deduction, quantification theory, analogy and probable inference, Mill's Methods of experimental inquiry, science and hypothesis, and probability. Reformulates key logical issues, and presents a more detailed account of the concept of logical equivalence, distinguishing it more clearly from the truth-functional connectives. Includes sidebars containing additional, enriching information; many new illustrations taken from contemporary research I the physical and biological science; and a plethora of exercises. For anyone searching for a top-notch, easy-to-understand introduction to logic.</p><p>Copi and Cohen&#39;s Introduction to Logic, Ninth Edition, is by far the most complete treatment of introductory logic, both deductive and inductive, both classical and modern. It is the standard text in logic today--the paradigm of clarity and accuracy. This text enables all students to understand, recognize, and apply classical syllogistic logic and the more powerful techniques of modern symbolic logic. Lively argumentative excerpts from politics, philosophy, science, and contemporary controversies bring substance and life to the study of logic--demonstrating the application of logical principles by serious writers and thinkers trying to solve real problems. Arguments excerpted as illustrations and as exercise material include examples of fallacies to show students how arguments go wrong when logical principles are ignored or misapplied. A few examples of argumentative reasoning were constructed for the book to demonstrate principles; however, it is the wealth of current, up-to-date examples selected from actual texts representing many fields of interest that set this book apart.<p> Many changes will be found in this new edition of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> but instructors who have used previous editions may be assured that the integrity and spirit of this book have been retained. Much of the detail of previous editions and most of the exercises also have been retained. The changes introduced&#x2014;of five different kinds&#x2014;are designed to make this well-tested volume more accessible, and thus more effective as an instrument in the teaching of elementary logic. We recount these changes briefly here, addressing this report mainly to those acquainted with previous editions. </p> <p><b><i>A Revised Chapter 1.</i></b></p> <p> Structural changes have been made in the first part of the book. The expansion of the opening chapters in the preceding edition was found by many users to hinder student progress along what may be called "the main line" of instruction in logic. We have therefore compressed the material of what was Part One into a single opening chapter in which the same topics are addressed, but more crisply, and in ways likely to provide a better base for the more advanced material in the later chapters of the book. Chapter 1 has now become very hefty as a result&#x2014;but it is also richer, more clearly formulated, and more fun to read. </p> <p><b><i>Exposition-Rules and Definitions.</i></b></p> <p> The most pervasive of the changes in this edition, and most important too, we think, are the very many adjustments in the ways in which theoretical matters are explained and expressed. We have long prided ourselves on the logical accuracy of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> and of course we would do nothing to injure our hard-earned reputation for reliability. But our colleagues around the country have advised us, on many occasions, that our efforts to be exact, and to cut no corners, have in some parts of the book resulted in formulations rather difficult to digest&#x2014;especially for beginning students. </p> <p> This is not an easy matter to address. We have worked hard to ameliorate this problem&#x2014;and if we have succeeded in this edition many of the resultant changes will be hardly noticeable. Explanations should be formulated in language that is transparent and thoroughly perspicuous, and (we hope) that will cause few brows to wrinkle. </p> <p> Some illustrations of the kind of changes we have made are worth noting. Several of our colleagues observed that, where a set of rules or criteria have been put forward (as, for example, those to test the validity of categorical syllogisms, or to appraise the merit of analogical arguments), our exposition relied too heavily, in referring to a rule, upon the number assigned to it rather than to the substance of the rule itself. We have reformulated such exposition, consistently referring now to the rule itself. </p> <p> Another example of reformulation will be noted in the chapter on definition. Previously, in explaining methods of defining, we caused needless confusion by using that much misunderstood word "connotation." The terms "connotation" and "denotation" were not employed erroneously, but to avoid confusion, we now rely fully upon the terms "intension" and "extension" in explaining techniques of definition. </p> <p> Even format can serve to confuse, or to clarify. It was and remains our practice, in presenting deductive exercises in symbols, to mark the conclusion of an argument with the three triangular dots (.-.) that commonly represent "therefore." But in earlier editions we had sometimes placed this sign on the same line as the last premise of the argument, after a slash; and sometimes we had placed this sign on a separate line of its own. This proved to be a source of distraction if not confusion, so we now consistently place the three-dot "therefore" sign of conclusion on a separate line. This format enables students to see more sharply the claim that the argument is making, and what the target of a needed proof must be. </p> <p> Many such adjustments appear in this edition, far too many to permit their identification in this Preface. In some cases the change is no more than the clarification of a transition, in others the tightening of a paragraph in which the prose was blurred. A textbook in logic ought to be concise, but it must also be precise; precision and clarity we have prized above all. </p> <p> Along with such adjustments we have sought, where feasible, to strike a lighter and more friendly tone in this edition, to introduce illustrations or observations that may amuse as they instruct. The study of logic is sometimes laborious, but it need not be forbidding. </p> <p><b><i>Sidebars.</i></b></p> <p> Those who study logic with the help of this book differ very greatly in the range of their interests and in the degree of their preparation. We will not be satisfied if we fail to challenge those who are most well prepared and most acute; but those coming to systematic logic for the first time also deserve support and guidance appropriate for them. To this end, we have introduced a device that is wholly new to <i>Introduction to Logic:</i> We have sought to distinguish some portions in some chapters that may, for good reasons, be omitted in some learning contexts, or may be treated by instructors as tangential to "the main line." These portions can serve to challenge some students who feel ready for additional work. </p> <p> Finding a way to do this without injury to the whole is problematic. We have adopted the simple device of a sidebar. These sidebars take two forms, "Advanced Material" and "For Enrichment." We emphasize that this contrivance is not meant to depreciate the passages so marked off, which are often especially interesting and demanding. But such sidebar material, we hope, will make it easier for instructors to guide their own students to a mastery of the elements of theory most critical for them&#x2014;and perhaps to avoid some complexities not essential for their solid grasp of elementary logic. Many instructors will simply ignore these markings, and may do so without damage to the understanding of their students. </p> <p><b><i>Technical Changes.</i></b></p> <p> Some technical changes have been introduced into this edition of <i>Introduction to Logic</i>&#x2014;changes that we think reduce ambiguity and thus support instruction. </p> <p> For example, we have responded to the frequently expressed concern of colleagues by expanding the discussion of logical equivalence in Chapter 8, now more sharply emphasizing the differences between material equivalence as a truth-functional connective, and logical equivalence as a logical relation that justifies the rules of replacement. An entirely new section on this topic (section 8.6) has been inserted, and in this section we have introduced a new symbol for logical equivalence as well. </p> <p> In earlier editions we allowed the equivalences expressed by the rules of replacement&#x2014;the last 10 of the 19 Rules of Inference&#x2014;to be symbolized by the same three-bar symbol with which material equivalence ("if and only if") is symbolized throughout. This practice had some justification, but it surely led to student confusion when, for example, rules of replacement were formulated in which the three-bar symbol appeared more than once, with more than one meaning. A distinct symbol was needed. </p> <p> Selecting that symbol has been a matter of long-continuing deliberation. Many alternatives were considered and rejected for reasons pedagogical or theoretical or aesthetic. We have chosen to retain the three-bar symbol, <i>over</i> which a small T indicates that the equivalence confronted is a tautology. This achieves the teaching aim, we think, with a minimum of disruption. Students are rarely called upon to write the symbol for logical equivalence&#x2014;but can (with this notation) recognize it unambiguously when it appears in the list of he rules of replacement that natural deduction employs. </p> <p> Elsewhere in the treatment of deduction, we have changed the design of Venn diagrams in representing Categorical Syllogisms. Where previously we had used simple shading to mark off what the premises of the argument rule out, we have in this edition used slanted lines. This permits the impact of each of the two premises of a syllogism to be distinguished, and because their lines are slanted in opposite directions, a cross-hatching results when the logical impacts of the two premises overlap. Different colors we chose not to use, not wanting to convey the suggestion that students would need anything more than an ordinary pencil to employ Venn diagrams for themselves. </p> <p><b><i>Revised Exercises.</i></b></p> <p> Finally, exercise sets provided at the close of many sections have been enriched. Many exercises have been added, some removed. As in previous editions of <i>Introduction to Logic,</i> we have sought to provide a wide array of illustrative passages, where possible on controversial issues likely to be of genuine interest to college students. Some contrived exercises are still used, or course, but we take pride in the fact that the exercises are for the most part extracted from worthy books and periodicals of very great variety. We have not excluded the writing of classical, and even ancient philosophers&#x2014;but we greatly favor arguments and illustrations produced in the push and pull of discourse in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. </p> <p> As in the past, we have scrupulously avoided partisanship in selecting these materials. When some passage provides a telling example of some mistake in reasoning, or a fine illustration of some argumentative technique, we have included it whatever our judgment of its conclusion might be. What we wrote in the Preface to the preceding edition we again affirm: The argumentative chips must be allowed to fall where they may. </p> <p> Finally, we draw attention to the substantial influence of criticisms and suggestions received from colleagues, senior and junior&#x2014;whose names and institutions are noted elsewhere in these pages. We strive to make <i>Introduction to Logic</i> a teaching instrument ever more finely tuned, and the responses of readers around the world have given us splendid help in spotting errors and identifying deficiencies. We earnestly welcome this thoughtful engagement-and for this continuing and widespread support we express here, not for the first or the last time, our heartfelt appreciation. </p></p><h2>Alcamo's Microbes and Society (Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning Topics in Biology)</h2><p>An Extensive Revision of an Essential Text for a Foundational Course in the Life Sciences<br><br>Perennial best-seller Alcamo&#x2019;s Microbes and Society is the ideal text for non-majors taking a foundational course in the life sciences.

In this lively and generously illustrated book, historians Maurice Isserman and Stewart Weaver present the first comprehensive history of Himalayan mountaineering in fifty years. They offer detailed, original accounts of the most significant climbs since the 1890s, and they compellingly evoke the social and cultural worlds that gave rise to those expeditions.</p><p>The book recounts the adventures of such figures as Martin Conway, who led the first authentic Himalayan climbing expedition in 1892; Fanny Bullock Workman, the pioneer explorer of the Karakoram range; George Mallory, the romantic martyr of Mount Everest fame; Charlie Houston, who led American expeditions to K2 in the 1930s and 1950s; Ang Tharkay, the legendary Sherpa, and many others. Throughout, the authors discuss the effects of political and social change on the world of mountaineering, and they offer a penetrating analysis of a culture that once emphasized teamwork and fellowship among climbers, but now has been eclipsed by a scramble for individual fame and glory.</p></p><p><p>A conversation with Maurice Isserman and Stewart Weaver</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: <i>What distinguishes your book from the many others on mountains and mountaineering?</i></p><p>A: <i>Fallen Giants</i> is the first comprehensive history of Himalayan mountaineering to appear since the mid-1950s. It is also the first attempt to tell the story of Himalayan mountaineering from the bottom up,&#x201d; which is to say understanding mountain climbers as the products of particular times and particular cultures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: <i>What do you mean by fallen giants&#x201d;?</i></p><p>A: The title is, on one level, meant to be ironic. After climbing Nanda Devi in the Indian Garhwal region of the Himalaya in 1936, the British climber Bill Tilman wrote regretfully that the first time a great mountain is ascended, some of its mystery and grandeur&#x201d; are diminished. He added that a book recounting the fall of one of the giants&#x201d; would be bought or by mountaineers more likely borrowed with misgiving and read with loathing.&#x201d; We hope our book will inspire feelings other than misgiving and loathing, even though it describes the fall of many such giants. But the title has another meaning, because in <i>Fallen Giants</i> we are chronicling the rise and fall of a set of values and norms that once nurtured a strong sense of fellowship and responsibility to others among mountaineers. In the later decades of the 20th century, such attitudes faltered on the slopes of high peaks, as the ideal of a brotherhood of the rope&#x201d; succumbed to self-seeking commercialism and a reckless indifference to others. So we are not just recording the falling&#x201d; of mountain giants in our book; we are also paying tribute to admirable and endangered values, embodied in mountaineers like Tilman and his longtime climbing partner Eric Shipton, as well as such American climbers as Charlie Houston and Bob Bates, among others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: <i>Are either of you mountaineers yourselves?</i></p><p>A: Not like the ones we write about. We share a love of mountains and have spent a lot of time climbing and trekking, including in the Himalaya. But we cannot, alas, claim the ascent of a single 8,000-meter peak between us. Our hope is that as historians we bring other useful abilities to bear on telling the story of Himalayan mountaineering.</p><b>Maurice Isserman</b> is James L.

Toga-clad Romans, sweeping vistas of vineyards and olive groves, the majesty of a Papal mass, Dante's <em>Comedia</em>, and Leonardo's haunting <em>Mona Lisa</em>. Few nations can boast as rich an artistic and cultural legacy, and yet, the concept of Italy as a single, autonomous political entity is a young one, dating back a mere 125 years. Fragmented both by North-South rivalries and foreign invasions, the peninsula struggled for nearly 1500 years after the fall of the Roman Empire to become a cohesive whole.<br> Now, in <em>The Oxford History of Italy</em>, two millennia of political turmoil and artistic glory are brought to life. Written by twelve leading scholars, this attractively designed volume paints a vivid portrait that ranges from the first hints of a nascent Italian consciousness (which often clashed with Rome's authority in the first century), to the Fascist struggles of the twentieth. We discover how the sack of Rome in 410 by the Goths created an enormous power vacuum, filled only by the proliferation of city-states and the ascendancy of the Pope. The book examines the artistic explosion of the Renaissance, illuminates the legacy of the Medici family and the great Italian masters--Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael--and visits ports such as Venice and commercial centers such as Milan, which prospered in the aftershock of the Black Death and the Great Schism. And the contributors explore the succeeding economic and political troubles of the following centuries: sharp depressions, inter-state wars, foreign invasions first by Spain, then by Austria and France. Not until the 19th century upsurge in nationalist fervor, fueled by Garibaldi's victorious war against the Habsburg overlords, was Italy's future as an independent nation guaranteed. Yet even today, Italy's political atmosphere is stormy: from the lingering Fascist sentiments, to the growing Northern separatist movement, to the rampant corruption that rocks the government and topples Prime Ministers with shocking regularity, Italy remains in a state of flux.<br> Lavishly illustrated with hundreds of pictures--including 24 pages of color plates--this attractive volume is an essential history for anyone interested in Italy. From the grandeur of Rome to the contentious politics of modern times, <em>The Oxford History of Italy</em> provides an authoritative and unforgettable journey through this remarkable land.</p><p>George Holmes&#39;s well-written, heavily illustrated narrative offers a broad view of Italian history from the early days of the Roman empire to the beginning of the 1990s. Italy as we know it, Holmes notes, is a fairly modern invention, the product of the 19th-century Risorgimiento and the unification of the nation for the first time in centuries. He explores the reasons for this, noting the tendency of Italian regions to turn inward and form small alliances with immediate neighbors, a tendency that expresses itself today in the northern Italian movement for secession. Holmes also considers the role of the arts in the formation of Italian identity and provides snapshots of major points in the nation&#39;s history.

Lungman is a Swedish scholar whose work has been well received by linguists and semioticians worldwide.</p>Never before published in the United States, this authoritative four-part history, dictionary, and index of non-iconic symbols is a revision of the author's Symboler , published in Sweden in 1974. Part 1 concisely traces the historical development of symbols since their first appearance about 20,000 years ago, then develops several topical themes: astrological, hobo, and Nazi symbols, as well as modern business logotypes. Classification by form is difficult due to the diversity of symbols, yet about 1500 are painstakingly classified into 54 groups in Part 2 where the history, derivation, and meanings are described for each. In Part 3, verbal descriptions, e.g., "peace symbol," comprise the easily used word index. There are some oversights in the index (e.g., astrological signs, which are treated in some detail elsewhere, only appear sporadically), but this is not a major criticism. Part 4, a graphic index, references information in Part 2 by shape and form. All historical periods and geographical areas are treated. Engineering symbols are deliberately excluded. There is nothing else quite like this well-researched work; other titles are older or specialized. Although useful for scholars and specialists, this is excellent for general reference.

The volume opens with chapters in which the position of the monarchy and social and economic background of the period in its feudal, rural, and urban aspects are discussed. In the political sphere it describes the building up of the great continental dominions, which in the time of Henry II are known as the Angevin Empire, and the collapse of the battle of Bouvines in 1214; it embraces also the attempts of the English kings to establish their supremacy over Scotland and Wales, and the conquest of Ireland. The work of the ecclesiastical reformers and the conflicts between church and state associated with the archbishops Anselm and Becket and Pope Innocent III are discussed. The progress of education, the contribution of Englishmen to the twelth-century renaissance, the literature, and the art of the age are brought under review. Finally, the great development of the common law brought about by the legal reforms of Henry II is traced, and the book ends with a description of the events leading up Magna Carta and its sequel, civil war, in which the reign of King John was brought to a close.</p><p>A.

Either she falls into saving hands and becomes better, or she rapidly assumes the cosmopolitan standard of virtue and becomes worse.' <br> <br> The tale of Carrie Meeber's rise to stardom in the theatre and George Hurstwood's slow decline captures the twin poles of exuberance and exhaustion in modern city life as never before. The premier example of American naturalism, Dreiser's remarkable first novel has deeply influenced such key writers as William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Saul Bellow, and Joyce Carol Oates. This edition uses the 1900 text, which is regarded as the author's final version.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

The story of Carrie Meeber, an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman, was strong stuff at the turn of the century, and what Dreiser's wary publisher released was a highly expurgated version. Times change, and we now have a restored "author's cut" of <i>Sister Carrie</i> that shows how truly ahead of his time Dreiser was. First and foremost, he has written an astute, nonmoralizing account of a woman and her limited options in late-19th-century America. That's impressive in and of itself, but Dreiser doesn't stop there. Digging deeply into the psychological underpinnings of his characters, he gives us people who are often strangers to themselves, drifting numbly until fate pushes them on a path they can later neither defend nor even remember choosing.<p> Dreiser's story unfolds in the measured cadences of an earlier era. This sometimes works brilliantly as we follow the choices, small and large, that lead some characters to doom and others to glory. On the other hand, the middle chapters--of which there are many--do drag somewhat, even when one appreciates Dreiser's intentions. If you can make it through the sagging midsection, however, you'll be rewarded by <i>Sister Carrie</i>'s last 150 pages, which depict the harrowing downward spiral of one of the book's central characters. Here Dreiser portrays with brutal power how the wrong decision--or lack of decision--can lay waste to a life. <i>--Rebecca Gleason</i></p>Theodore Dreiser had a hardscrabble youth and the years of newspaper work behind him when he began his first novel, <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the story of a beautiful Midwestern girl who makes it big in New York City. Published by Doubleday in 1900, it gained a reputation as a shocker, for Dreiser had dared to give the public a heroine whose "cosmopolitan standard of virtue" brings her from Wisconsin, with four dollars in her purse, to a suite at the Waldorf and glittering fame as an actress. With <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the original manuscript of which is in the New York Public Library collections, Dreiser told a tale not "sufficiently delicate" for many of its first readers and critics, but which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential American novels.</p><h2>Discovering God&#39;s Way of Handling Money: A Financial Study for Teens Workbook</h2><p>Used.

Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee squared off for more than nine months in their struggle for Petersburg, the key to the Confederate capital at Richmond. Featuring some of the war's most notorious battles, the campaign played out against a backdrop of political drama and crucial fighting elsewhere, with massive costs for soldiers and civilians alike. After failing to bull his way into Petersburg, Grant concentrated on isolating the city from its communications with the rest of the surviving Confederacy, stretching Lee's defenses to the breaking point. When Lee's desperate breakout attempt failed in March 1865, Grant launched his final offensives that forced the Confederates to abandon the city on April 2, 1865. A week later, Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House.<br><br>Here A.

The book chronicles the maturing of Wolfe's autobiographical character, Eugene Gant, in his desperate search for fulfillment, making his way from small-town North Carolina to the wider world of Harvard University, New York City, and Europe. In a massive, ambitious, and boldly passionate novel, Wolfe examines the passing of time and the nature of the creative process, as Gant slowly but ecstatically embraces the urban life, recognizing it as a necessary ordeal for the birth of his creative genius as a writer. <br> The work of an exceptionally expressive writer of fertile imagination and startling emotional intensity, <i>Of Time and the River</i> illuminates universal truths about art and life, city and country, past and present. It is a novel that is majestic and enduring. As P. M. Jack observed in <i>The New York Times,</i> "It is a triumphant demonstration that Thomas Wolfe has the stamina to produce a magnificent epic of American life." <br> This edition, published in celebration of Wolfe's centennial anniversary, contains a new introduction by Pat Conroy.</p><p>Thomas Wolfe (1900&#x2013;1938) was born in Asheville, North Carolina, and educated at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University. He taught English at New York University and traveled extensively in Europe and America. Wolfe created his legacy as a classic American novelist with <i>Look Homeward, Angel</i>; <i>Of Time and the River</i>; <i>A Stone, a Leaf, a Door</i>; and <i>From Death to Morning</i>.<b>Chapeter One</b><br><br>About fifteen years ago, at the end of the second decade of this century, four people were standing together on the platform of the railway station of a town in the hills of western Catawba. This little station, really just a suburban adjunct of the larger town which, behind the concealing barrier of a rising ground, swept away a mile or two to the west and north, had become in recent years the popular point of arrival and departure for travellers to and from the cities of the east, and now, in fact, accommodated a much larger traffic than did the central station of the town, which was situated two miles westward around the powerful bend of the rails. For this reason a considerable number of people were now assembled here, and from their words and gestures, a quietly suppressed excitement that somehow seemed to infuse the drowsy mid-October afternoon with an electric vitality, it was possible to feel the thrill and menace of the coming train.<br><br>An observer would have felt in the complexion of this gathering a somewhat mixed quality -- a quality that was at once strange and familiar, alien and native, cosmopolitan and provincial. It was not the single native quality of the usual crowd that one saw on the station platforms of the typical Catawba town as the trains passed through. This crowd was more mixed and varied, and it had a strong coloring of worldly smartness, the element of fashionable sophistication that one sometimes finds in a place where a native and alien population have come together. And such an inference was here warranted: the town of Altamont a mile or so away was a well-known resort and the mixed gathering on the station platform was fairly representative of its population. But all of these people, both strange and native, had been drawn here by a common experience, an event which has always been of first interest in the lives of all Americans. This event is the coming of the train.<br><br>It would have been evident to an observer that of the four people who were standing together at one end of the platform three -- the two women and the boy -- were connected by the relationship of blood. A stranger would have known instantly that the boy and the young woman were brother and sister and that the woman was their mother. The relationship was somehow one of tone, texture, time, and energy, and of the grain and temper of the spirit. The mother was a woman of small but strong and solid figure. Although she was near her sixtieth year, her hair was jet black and her face, full of energy and power, was almost as smooth and unlined as the face of a girl. Her hair was brushed back from a forehead which was high, white, full, and naked-looking, and which, together with the expression of her eyes, which were brown, and rather worn and weak, but constantly thoughtful, constantly reflective, gave her face the expression of straight grave innocence that children have, and also of strong native intelligence and integrity. Her skin was milk white, soft of texture, completely colorless save for the nose, which was red, broad and fleshy at the base, and curiously masculine.<br><br>A stranger seeing her for the first time would have known somehow that the woman was a member of a numerous family, and that her face had the tribal look. He would somehow have felt certain that the woman had brothers and that if he could see them, they would look like her. Yet, this masculine quality was not a quality of sex, for the woman, save for the broad manlike nose, was as thoroughly female as a woman could be. It was rather a quality of tribe and character -- a tribe and character that was decisively masculine.<br><br>The final impression of the woman might have been this: -- that her life was somehow above and beyond a moral judgment, that no matter what the course or chronicle of her life may have been, no matter what crimes of error, avarice, ignorance, or thoughtlessness might be charged to her, no matter what suffering or evil consequences may have resulted to other people through any act of hers, her life was somehow beyond these accidents of time, training, and occasion, and the woman was as guiltless as a child, a river, an avalanche, or any force of nature whatsoever.<br><br>The younger of the two women was about thirty years old. She was a big woman, nearly six feet tall, large, and loose of bone and limb, almost gaunt. Both women were evidently creatures of tremendous energy, but where the mother suggested a constant, calm, and almost tireless force, the daughter was plainly one of those big, impulsive creatures of the earth who possess a terrific but undisciplined vitality, which they are ready to expend with a whole-souled and almost frenzied prodigality on any person, enterprise, or object which appeals to their grand affections.<br><br>This difference between the two women was also reflected in their faces. The face of the mother, for all its amazing flexibility, the startled animal-like intentness with which her glance darted from one object to another, and the mobility of her powerful and delicate mouth, which she pursed and convolved with astonishing flexibility in such a way as to show the constant reflective effort of her mind, was nevertheless the face of a woman whose spirit had an almost elemental quality of patience, fortitude and calm.<br><br>The face of the younger woman was large, high-boned, and generous and already marked by the frenzy and unrest of her own life. At moments it bore legibly and terribly the tortured strain of hysteria, of nerves stretched to the breaking point, of the furious impatience, unrest and dissonance of her own tormented spirit, and of impending exhaustion and collapse for her overwrought vitality. Yet, in an instant, this gaunt, strained, tortured, and almost hysterical face could be transformed by an expression of serenity, wisdom, and repose that would work unbelievably a miracle of calm and radiant beauty on the nervous, gaunt, and tortured features.<br><br>Now, each in her own way, the two women were surveying the other people on the platform and the new arrivals with a ravenous and absorptive interest, bestowing on each a wealth of information, comment, and speculation which suggested an encyclop?dic knowledge of the history of every one in the community.<br><br>" -- Why, yes, child," the mother was saying impatiently, as she turned her quick glance from a group of people who at the moment were the subject of discussion -- "that's what I'm telling you! -- Don't I know?...Didn't I grow up with all those people?...Wasn't Emma Smathers one of my girlhood friends?...That boy's not this woman's child at all. He's Emma Smathers' child by that first marriage."<br><br>"Well, that's news to me," the younger woman answered. "That's certainly news to me. I never knew Steve Randolph had been married more than once. I'd always thought that all that bunch were Mrs. Randolph's children."<br><br>"Why, of course not!" the mother cried impatiently. "She never had any of them except Lucille. All the rest of them were Emma's children. Steve Randolph was a man of forty-five when he married her. He'd been a widower for years -- poor Emma died in childbirth when Bernice was born -- nobody ever thought he'd marry again and nobody ever expected this woman to have any children of her own for she was almost as old as he was -- why, yes! -- hadn't she been married before, a widow, you know, when she met him, came here after her first husband's death from some place way out West -- oh, Wyoming, or Nevada or Idaho, one of those States, you know -- and had never had chick nor child, as the saying goes -- till she married Steve. And that woman was every day of forty-four years old when Lucille was born."<br><br>"Uh-huh!...Ah-hah!" the younger woman muttered absently, in a tone of rapt and fascinated interest, as she looked distantly at the people in the other group, and reflectively stroked her large chin with a big, bony hand. "So Lucille, then, is really John's half-sister?"<br><br>"Why, of course!" the mother cried. "I thought every one knew that. Lucille's the only one that this woman can lay claim to. The rest of them were Emma's."<br><br>" -- Well, that's certainly news to me," the younger woman said slowly as before. "It's the first <i>I</i> ever heard of it....And you say she was forty-four when Lucille was born?"<br><br>"Now, she was all of <i>that,"</i> the mother said. "I know. And she may have been even older."<br><br>"Well," the younger woman said, and now she turned to her silent husband, Barton, with a hoarse snigger, "it just goes to show that while there's life there's hope, doesn't it? So cheer up, honey," she said to him, "we may have a chance yet." But despite her air of rough banter her clear eyes for a moment had a look of deep pain and sadness in them.<br><br>"Chance!" the mother cried strongly, with a little scornful pucker of the lips -- "why, of course there is! If I was your age again I'd have a dozen -- and never think a thing of it." For a moment she was silent, pursing her reflective lips. Suddenly a faint sly smile began to flicker at the edges of her lips, and turning to the boy, she addressed him with an air of sly and bantering mystery:<br><br>"Now, boy," she said -- "there's lots of things that you don't know...you always thought you were the last -- the youngest -- didn't you?"<br><br>"Well, wasn't I?" he said.<br><br>"H'm!" she said with a little scornful smile and an air of great mystery -- "There's lots that I could tell you -- -- "<br><br>"Oh, my God!" he groaned, turning towards his sister with an imploring face. "More mysteries!...The next thing I'll find that there were five sets of triplets after I was born -- Well, come on, Mama," he cried impatiently. "Don't hint around all day about it....What's the secret now -- how many were there?"<br><br>"H'm!" she said with a little bantering, scornful, and significant smile.<br><br>"O Lord!" he groaned again -- "Did she ever tell you what it was?" Again he turned imploringly to his sister.<br><br>She snickered hoarsely, a strange high-husky and derisive falsetto laugh, at the same time prodding him stiffly in the ribs with her big fingers:<br><br>"Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi," she laughed. "More spooky business, hey? You don't know the half of it. She'll be telling you next you were only the fourteenth."<br><br>"H'm!" the older woman said, with a little scornful smile of her pursed lips. "Now I could tell him more than that! The fourteenth! Pshaw!" she said contemptuously -- "I could tell him -- -- "<br><br>"O God!" he groaned miserably. "I knew it!...I don't want to hear it."<br><br>"K, k, k, k, k," the younger woman snickered derisively, prodding him in the ribs again.<br><br>"No, sir," the older woman went on strongly -- "and that's not all either! -- Now, boy, I want to tell you something that you didn't know," and as she spoke she turned the strange and worn stare of her serious brown eyes on him, and levelled a half-clasped hand, fingers pointing, a gesture loose, casual, and instinctive and powerful as a man's. -- "There's a lot I could tell you that you never heard. Long years after you were born, child -- why, at the time I took you children to the Saint Louis Fair -- " here her face grew stern and sad, she pursed her lips strongly and shook her head with a short convulsive movement -- "oh, when I think of it -- to think what I went through -- oh, awful, awful, you know," she whispered ominously.<br><br>"Now, Mama, for God's sake, I don't want to hear it!" he fairly shouted, beside himself with exasperation and foreboding. "God-damn it, can we have no peace -- even when I go away!" he cried bitterly and illogically. "Always these damned gloomy hints and revelations -- this Pentland spooky stuff," he yelled -- "this damned I-could-if-I-wanted-to-tell-you air of mystery, horror, and damnation!" he shouted incoherently. "Who cares? What does it matter?" he cried, adding desperately, "I don't want to hear about it -- No one cares."<br><br>"Why, child, now, I was only saying -- " she began hastily and diplomatically.<br><br>"All right, all right, all right," he muttered. "I don't care -- -- "<br><br>"But, as I say, now," she resumed.<br><br>"I don't care!" he shouted. "Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace," he muttered in a crazy tone as he turned to his sister. "A moment's peace for all of us before we die. A moment of peace, peace, peace."<br><br>"Why, boy, I'll vow," the mother said in a vexed tone, fixing her reproving glance on him, "what on earth's come over you? You act like a regular crazy man. I'll vow you do."<br><br>"A moment's peace!" he muttered again, thrusting one hand wildly through his hair. "I beg and beseech you for a moment's peace before we perish!"<br><br>"K, k, k, k, k," the younger woman snickered derisively, as she poked him stiffly in the ribs -- "There's no peace for the weary. It's like that river that goes on forever," she said with a faint loose curving of lewd humor around the edges of her generous big mouth -- "Now you see, don't you?" she said, looking at him with this lewd and challenging look. "You see what it's like now, don't you?...<i>You're</i> the lucky one! <i>You</i> got away! You're smart enough to go way off somewhere to college -- to Boston -- Harvard -- anywhere -- but <i>you're</i> away from it. You get it for a short time when you come home. How do you think <i>I</i> stand it?" she said challengingly. "I have to hear it <i>all</i> the time....Oh, <i>all</i> the time, and <i>all</i> the time, and <i>all</i> the time!" she said with a kind of weary desperation. "If they'd only leave me <i>alone</i> for five minutes some time I think I'd be able to pull myself together, but it's this way <i>all</i> the time and <i>all</i> the time and <i>all</i> the time. You see, don't you?"<br><br>But now, having finished, in a tone of hoarse and panting exasperation, her frenzied protest, she relapsed immediately into a state of marked, weary, and dejected resignation.<br><br>"Well, I know, I know," she said in a weary and indifferent voice."...Forget about it....Talking does no good....Just try to make the best of it the little time you're here....I used to think something could be done about it...but I know different now," she muttered, although she would have been unable to explain the logical meaning of these incoherent and disjointed phrases.<br><br>"Hah?...What say?" the mother now cried sharply, darting her glances from one to another with the quick, startled, curiously puzzled intentness of an animal or a bird. "What say?" she cried sharply again, as no one answered. "I thought -- -- "<br><br>But fortunately, at this moment, this strange and disturbing flash in which had been revealed the blind and tangled purposes, the powerful and obscure impulses, the tormented nerves, the whole tragic perplexity of soul which was of the very fabric of their lives, was interrupted by a commotion in one of the groups upon the platform, and by a great guffaw of laughter which instantly roused these three people from this painful and perplexing scene, and directed their startled attention to the place from which the laughter came.<br><br>And now again they heard the great guffaw -- a solid "Haw! Haw! Haw!" which was full of such an infectious exuberance of animal good-nature that other people on the platform began to smile instinctively, and to look affectionately towards the owner of the laugh.<br><br>Already, at the sound of the laugh, the young woman had forgotten the weary and dejected resignation of the moment before, and with an absent and yet eager look of curiosity in her eyes, she was staring towards the group from which the laugh had come, and herself now laughing absently, she was stroking her big chin in a gesture of meditative curiosity, saying:<br><br>"Hah!

Why is your book timely-- what makes it important right now?</strong></p> <p>A. We&#x2019;re seeing a massive increase in the demand for well-designed, easy-to-use products. At the same time, we&#x2019;re seeing an incredible shortage of designers who can work at the sort of fast-paced, data-driven, innovative startups that are popping up. UX for Lean Startups helps teach founders and entrepreneurs the basics of research, design, and UX so that they can build products people love and companies that can grow. </p> <p><strong>Q. What information do you hope that readers of your book will walk away with?</strong></p> <p>A. I hope that everybody who reads the book will be able to learn from their customers and turn that information into products that people will actually buy. I want startups to stop building things people don&#x2019;t want and can&#x2019;t use. This book can help them do that. </p> <p><strong>Q. What's the most exciting and/or important thing happening in your space?</strong></p> <p>A. I think the addition of data is the most important change to design that I&#x2019;ve seen. By incorporating real data into the design process, we can understand exactly what effect our changes have on our users&#x2019; behavior. It used to be that design was about opinion and compromise. Now it&#x2019;s about proving that the work we do has a positive impact on the company&#x2019;s bottom line. </p> <p><strong>Laura's top 5 tips for readers:</strong></p> <p>1. Talking to users is not as good as listening to users, which is not as good as observing users. The best way to truly understand your user experience is to watch people trying to use your product. Do this as often as possible. It can be painful, but it&#x2019;s always useful. <br><br>2. Know that something you believe may be wrong. The most important thing you can do is to identify which of your beliefs are assumptions and validate them. Before you spend a lot of time designing and building a feature, spend a little time validating whether or not the feature will help your business. <br><br>3. Quantitative research tells you what. Qualitative research tells you why. Things like A/B testing and funnel analysis (quant) are useful for explaining things like which design caused people to buy more products and where people fell out of the purchase funnel. Things like observational research and usability testing (qual) can tell you why users responded better to a particular design and why users are getting dropping out of the purchase funnel. Use them together for the best results. <br><br>4. An MVP is not half of a big product. It&#x2019;s a whole small product. Don&#x2019;t build something crappy and unusable and then claim it&#x2019;s a minimum viable product. Build a good, but limited, version of your product that solves a serious problem for people. <br><br>5. Lean Startup is about learning, not landing pages. Whenever you&#x2019;re wondering whether you should use a specific Lean Startup tactic, like a landing page or an MVP or an A/B test, ask yourself what you hope to learn from it and whether there is a cheaper, faster, more effective way to get that learning. Just measuring things doesn&#x2019;t make you lean. The only way to truly be a Lean Startup is to Build, Measure, and Learn (and then Iterate). </p><p>Laura has spent 15 years as an engineer and designer. Her goal is to help lean startups learn more about their customers so that they can build better products faster.Her popular design blog, Users Know, teaches product owners exactly what they need to know to do just enough research and design.</p></p><h2>Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream</h2><p>Newly revised, this comic play by Shakespeare features a new Introduction by Sylvan Barnet, former Chairman of the English Department at Tufts University, an updated bibliography, suggested references, and stage and film history.</p><p>William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English dramatist, poet, and actor, generally regarded as the greatest playwright of all time.</p><h2>France 1848-1945, Vol. 1: Ambition, Love, and Politics (Oxford History of Modern Europe)</h2><p>This is a history of the French, which attempts to explain their idiosyncrasies, enthusiasms, and prejudices.

It enquires into the quality of life, the French view of happiness, friendship and comfort, humor, reactions to scientific progress, compromises with corruption, and superstition.

Fergus Kerr - one of the foremost Roman Catholic theologians currently writing in English - discusses the theological development of each figure and their relationship to Church teaching. He highlights how each one contributed to the reform and renewal of the Church at the Second Vatican Council. The study of Thomas Aquinas was mandatory in their student years, yet each found his own distinctive way of dealing with this requirement. In the work of Hans Urs von Balthasar and the late Pope John Paul II, the neoscholastic metaphysics that dominated in the first half of the century gave way in the second half to a theology of the body, gender difference and nuptiality.This book offers a lively and succinct account of Catholic theology from 1900 to the present day.

Therefore you ought to respect their little prejudices, and humor their little whims, and put up with their little foibles until they get to crowding you too much.</i></p><p>When Mark Twain wrote the sparky short story "Advice to Little Girls" in 1865, he probably didn't mean for it to be shown to them. Or maybe he did, since we all know Twain was a rascal. Now, author and illustrator Vladimir Radunsky has created a picture book based on Twain's text that adds all the right outlandish touches.</p><p>Born on November 30, 1835, in Florida, Missouri, Samuel L. Clemens wrote under the pen name <b>Mark Twain</b>. He wrote two major classics of American literature, <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i> and <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>. He was also a riverboat pilot, journalist, lecturer, entrepreneur, and inventor. Whether or not it was Mark Twain's actual intention for little girls to read this humorous short story, it's clear that he did not talk down to children, but rather expected them to stretch themselves in order to grasp sophisticated, adult meaning.</p><p><b>Vladimir Radunsky </b>has illustrated many books to great acclaim. Recently, Radunsky has been moving farther and farther away from the traditional picture book and into other more innovative forms. The most recent example is a work published by HarperCollins of hip-hop poetry for children, where the graffiti art has migrated from the walls into a printed book. Radunsky has published more than thirty books for children, mostly in the United States. Many of them were translated and published in France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Japan.</p></p><p><b>Vladimir Radunsky</b> has illustrated many wonderful books, including <i>The Maestro Plays</i> by Bill Martin Jr and Woody Guthrie's <i>Howdi Do</i>.

It provides chapter-by-chapter analysis, explanations of key themes, motifs and symbols, a review quiz, and essay topics. It is suitable for late-night studying and paper writing.</p><p>At the height of the Harlem Renaissance during the 1930s, Zora Neale Hurston was the preeminent black woman writer in the United States. She was a sometime-collaborator with Langston Hughes and a fierce rival of Richard Wright. Her stories appeared in major magazines, she consulted on Hollywood screenplays, and she penned four novels, an autobiography, countless essays, and two books on black mythology. Yet by the late 1950s, Hurston was living in obscurity, working as a maid in a Florida hotel. She died in 1960 in a Welfare home, was buried in an unmarked grave, and quickly faded from literary consciousness until 1975 when Alice Walker almost single-handedly revived interest in her work. <p> Of Hurston's fiction, <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> is arguably the best-known and perhaps the most controversial. The novel follows the fortunes of Janie Crawford, a woman living in the black town of Eaton, Florida. Hurston sets up her characters and her locale in the first chapter, which, along with the last, acts as a framing device for the story of Janie's life. Unlike Wright and Ralph Ellison, Hurston does not write explicitly about black people in the context of a white world--a fact that earned her scathing criticism from the social realists--but she doesn't ignore the impact of black-white relations either: </p><blockquote> It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. </blockquote> One person the citizens of Eaton are inclined to judge is Janie Crawford, who has married three men and been tried for the murder of one of them. Janie feels no compulsion to justify herself to the town, but she <i>does</i> explain herself to her friend, Phoeby, with the implicit understanding that Phoeby can "tell 'em what Ah say if you wants to. Dat's just de same as me 'cause mah tongue is in mah friend's mouf." <p> Hurston's use of dialect enraged other African American writers such as Wright, who accused her of pandering to white readers by giving them the black stereotypes they expected. Decades later, however, outrage has been replaced by admiration for her depictions of black life, and especially the lives of black women. In <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> Zora Neale Hurston breathes humanity into both her men and women, and allows them to speak in their own voices. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p>One of the most important works of twentieth-century American literature, Zora Neale Hurston's beloved 1937 classic, <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em>, is an enduring Southern love story sparkling with wit, beauty, and heartfelt wisdom. Told in the captivating voice of a woman who refuses to live in sorrow, bitterness, fear, or foolish romantic dreams, it is the story of fair-skinned, fiercely independent Janie Crawford, and her evolving selfhood through three marriages and a life marked by poverty, trials, and purpose. A true literary wonder, Hurston's masterwork remains as relevant and affecting today as when it was first published&#x2014;perhaps the most widely read and highly regarded novel in the entire canon of African American literature. </p></p><h2>Chemistry: An Atoms First Approach, Loose-leaf Version</h2><p>Packed with the information, examples, and problems you need to learn to &#34;think like a chemist,&#34; CHEMISTRY: AN ATOMS FIRST APPROACH is designed to help you become an independent problem-solver.

On the basis of a wide range of qualitative and quantitative data, including interviews with art dealers in New York and Amsterdam, Olav Velthuis shows how contemporary art galleries juggle the contradictory logics of art and economics. In doing so, they rely on a highly ritualized business repertoire. For instance, a sharp distinction between a gallery's museumlike front space and its businesslike back space safeguards the separation of art from commerce.</p><br><p> Velthuis shows that prices, far from being abstract numbers, convey rich meanings to trading partners that extend well beyond the works of art. A high price may indicate not only the quality of a work but also the identity of collectors who bought it before the artist's reputation was established. Such meanings are far from unequivocal. For some, a high price may be a symbol of status; for others, it is a symbol of fraud.</p><br><p> Whereas sociological thought has long viewed prices as reducing qualities to quantities, this pathbreaking and engagingly written book reveals the rich world behind these numerical values. Art dealers distinguish different types of prices and attach moral significance to them. Thus the price mechanism constitutes a symbolic system akin to language.</p></p><p><p>"Olav Velthuis has built a graceful, sturdy bridge across a torrent: the turbulent flow of art markets. On one side we have the supposition that art and money follow incompatible principles; on the other, the claim that markets reduce all commodities to creatures of supply and demand. By looking closely at the actual culture and social connections of art markets in New York and Amsterdam, he arrives at insight after insight into a meaning-drenched form of commerce, and by extension into the place of meanings in markets of every kind. This bridge stands firm."<b>--Viviana A. Zelizer, author of <i>The Purchase of Intimacy</i> and <i>The Social Meaning of Money</i></b></p><p>"A superb book! <i>Talking Prices</i> is the best thing I have yet to read on the way art markets-in any period-work. Written in the most fluid style, it is a pleasure to read and contains a great many juicy details that shed light on the inner workings of dealers and sellers and artists. Furthermore, it will carve out a space in the economic sociology of art that is occupied, at present, by nobody. Without question, it will leap across disciplinary boundaries, especially that huge and often ugly one between 'sociologists' and 'economists.' What tops it all off is that Velthuis is also an expert in art history and understands the aesthetic values and norms of composing art that matter not only to the artists who are selling to galleries, but also to the way in which artworks are sold and to the culture that shapes the way art markets operate. This is a major accomplishment."<b>--Jack Amariglio, Merrimack College, coauthor of <i>Postmodern Moments in Modern Economics</i></b></p><p>"A brilliant piece of work. Velthuis has taken the hardest case, and gotten out of it the best laws: about pricing, which the economist wants to read as prudence and the anthropologist wants to leave to the economist; and about high art, which the anthropologist wants to read as power and the economist wants to leave to the anthropologist. It's a brave book, and accomplishes what it ventures."<b>--Deirdre McCloskey, University of Illinois, Chicago, author of <i>Knowledge and Persuasion in Economics</i></b></p><b>Olav Velthuis</b> has worked as Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Konstanz and has been a Visiting Scholar at Princeton University and Columbia University. Currently he writes about economic affairs for the Dutch newspaper <i>De Volkskrant</i>.</p><h2>Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)</h2><p>A novel, in which Charles Gould returns to South America determined to make a success of the inheritance left to him by his father, the San Tome mine. But his dreams are thwarted as the country is plunged into revolution.</p><p>13 1.5-hour cassettes<p> <em>Nostromo</em>, first published in 1904, is arguably Conrad&#x2019;s greatest and most complex novel. A compelling adventure story, it is also a novel of profound psychological insight and of powerful political implications. It tells the story of a Central American state whose silver mine serves both literally and metaphorically as the source of the country&#x2018;s value. Written at the time of the development of the Panama Canal, <em>Nostromo</em> is set in the imaginary province of Sulaco, which secedes from the federation of Costaguana in order to protect its natural resource, the silver mine. The parallels with the &#x2018;revolution&#x2019; fomented in Panama by the United States in 1903 are striking; just as Panama seceded from Columbia to satisfy the material interests of the canal builders, so the secession of Sulaco serves the material interests of &#x2018;the Gould concession.&#x2019; In this edition a variety of documents from the period (including material concerning American involvement in Central America in the early twentieth century, early critical notices, and family letters of Conrad&#x2019;s) help to set the text in context. </p></p><h2>Our Deportment</h2><p>A KNOWLEDGE of etiquette has been defined to be a knowledge of the rules of society at its best.

Among the selections are drawings of plants, landscapes, animals, battles, weapons, and the human face and figure, as well as studies for later paintings or sculpture: a full compositional study for <i>The Adoration of the Magi,</i> a study for the angel's head in <i>The Virgin of the Rocks,</i> studies of horses for the Sforza monument, studies for <i>The Last Supper,</i> studies for <i>The Battle of Anghiari,</i> and an early cartoon for <i>The Madonna with St. Anne.</i></p></p><p>One of the great geniuses of Western civilization, Leonardo da Vinci (1452&#x2013;1519) is the true Renaissance man.

Now, in his long-awaited memoir, he tells the heroic story of how, in the late sixties, he and a group of friends from the Northeastern state of Bahia created <i>tropicalismo,</i> the movement that shook Brazilian culture--and civic order--to its foundations and pushed a nation then on the margins of world politics and economics into the pop avant-garde.<br><br><i>Tropical Truth </i>begins with a childhood in the Bahian hinterland, where Caetano (as Brazilians of all ages now call him) first heard not only the musical traditions of his own country and her Latin neighbors, but also the giants of postwar American song: Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Chet Baker, to name but a few. While teenagers in America would soon be enthralled by the primal (and commercial) beat of rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;roll, in Brazil it was bossa nova, that sublimely sophisticated music, that was to become the soundtrack of a generation. Inspired above all by bossa nova&#x2019;s supreme master, Jo�o Gilberto, Caetano and his crew would set about creating a totally new sound. <i>Tropicalismo</i> would aim to &#x201c;cannibalize&#x201d; the extraordinary beauty and richness of Brazil&#x2019;s musical past but at the same time to assimilate eclectically the most original elements of Anglo-American pop, an influence many rejected as yet another form of imperialism corrupting Brazil&#x2019;s &#x201c;authentic&#x201d; character.<br><br>The birth of <i>tropicalismo</i> coincided with the wave of counterculture sweeping Western nations, but in Brazil that wave would hit the breakwaters of a brutal military junta. While supporting resistance to right-wing oppression (and the terrible social inequities it perpetuated) the <i>tropicalistas</i> nevertheless rejected the automatic connection to the Left and its unreflective nationalism, then the politics de rigueur of the artistic class. Their third way foresaw a Brazil open to free markets but likewise free in itself. It was a vision so subversive of both the political and musical status quo that before long Caetano faced imprisonment and was then forced into exile until the early seventies. But when he returned, it was in triumph: Brazil, no less than the state of her popular music, would never be the same.<br><br> Rich with the satisfactions of a novel, weaving the story of a country with that of its most idealistic generation, <i>Tropical Truth </i>recounts the odyssey of a brilliant constellation of artists: Caetano and his sister Maria Beth�nia, the queen of Brazilian song; the black musical genius Gilberto Gil, Caetano's closest collaborator, with whom he was jailed and then banished; the great diva Gal Costa; the revolutionary filmmaker Glauber Rocha; the brothers de Campos, those luminaries of concrete poetry, who were among the <i>tropicalistas&#x2019;</i> learned mentors. Here is an unparalleled confluence of highbrow and pop, and with it the genesis of what has become one of the most wildly successful cultural exports ever produced by a nation other than the United States. <br>By turns erudite and playful, dreamlike and confessional, <i>Tropical Truth</i> is an utterly unexpected revelation of Brazil's most famous artist, one of the greatest popular composers of the past century.</p><p>Caetano Veloso was born in 1942 in Santo Amaro da Purifica��o, Bahia, Brazil. He lives in Bahia and Rio de Janeiro.Introduction<br><br>In the year 2000, Brazil commemorated not only the passing of the century and the millennium but also the five hundred years since her discovery. To this date, then, is attached an accumulation of meaning not shared with any other country in the world. And the flood of omens let loose at this juncture is closely allied with the psychology of Brazil-a failed nation ashamed of having once been called "the country of the future." In fact, those past expectations have today taken the form of a resignation that underlies new frustrations, but the magnitude of Brazil's disillusionment reveals that-fortunately or not-we remain very far from a sensible realism.<br><br>As children we learned that Brazil was discovered by the Portuguese navigator Pedro �lvarez Cabral on April 22, 1500. All other American nations consider it enough to have been discovered all together by Christopher Columbus in 1492. It was only Brazil that had to be discovered later, separately. From the earliest age, as a child in Santo Amaro de Purific�o in Bahia, I had to ask: "Why?"<br><br>They could have said, for example, that Columbus did not sail farther than the Caribbean islands and that the continent proper was only arrived at by the Portuguese eight years later; they could have told us that what Cabral discovered was the existence of South America, of which the Spaniards had not the slightest idea. But no: they say Brazil appeared as an independent continent, a huge island in the middle of the South Atlantic, a surprise for those Lusitanian sailors who, aiming to follow the coast of Africa to reach the Indies, sailed too far west. That such a vaguely defined event should be situated so precisely in the middle of the second millennium serves to force upon Brazilians a sense of themselves as a nation both unsubstantiated and exaggerated. The United States is a country without a name: America is the name of the continent where, among others, the states that were once English colonies united. Brazil is a name without a country. The English seem to have stolen the name of the continent and given it to the country they founded. The Portuguese seem not to have really founded a country, but managed to suggest that they landed in a part of America that was absolutely Other, and they called it Brazil.<br><br>The parallel with the United States is inevitable. If all the countries in the world today must measure themselves against "America," position themselves in relation to the American Empire, and if the other countries in America have to do so in an even more direct way&#x2013;comparing their respective histories to that of their stronger and more fortunate brother&#x2013;Brazil's case is even more acute, since the mirror image is more evident and the alienation more radical. Brazil is America's other giant, the <i>other melting pot </i>of races and cultures, the other promised land to European and Asian immigrants, the Other. The double, the shadow, the negative image of the great adventure of the New World. The sobriquet "sleeping giant," which was applied to the United States by Admiral Yamamoto, will be taken by any Brazilian as a reference to Brazil, and confused with the seemingly ominous words of the national anthem, "forever lying in a splendid cradle."<br><br>The papal bull that created the Treaty of Tordesillas, stipulating that lands yet to be discovered to the east of the agreed-upon meridian would belong to Portugal, leaving those to the west for Spain, explains the need for a new "discovery" and its being Portuguese. But in school we learn-and Pero Vaz de Caminha's beautiful letter reporting to the king about the voyage reassures us-that <i>chance</i> impelled Cabral's fleet on to the Brazilian coast. And that is how we came to have this immense floating world, the namesake of a utopian island imagined in the European Middle Ages, and perhaps less unreal than the latter, this enormous no-place with the burning name. (Brazil is usually assumed to be derived from "<i>braza</i>," burning coal or ember.)<br><br>In 1995, the Brazilian daily <i>Folha de Sao Paulo</i> bore this headline: "World Bank Report Indicates Brazil Is the Country with the Greatest Social and Economic Disparity in the World." The article reports that 51.3 percent of Brazilian income is concentrated in 10 percent of the population. The wealthiest 20 percent own 67.5 percent of Brazil, while the 20 percent who are poorest have only 2.1 percent. It was that way when I was a boy, and it is still that way. As we reached adolescence, my generation dreamed of inverting this brutal legacy.<br><br>In 1964, the military took power, motivated by the need to perpetuate those disparities that have proven to be the only way to make the Brazilian economy work (badly, needless to say) and, in the international arena, to defend the free market from the threat of the communist bloc (another American front of the Cold War). Students were either leftist or they would keep their mouths shut. Within the family or among one's circle of friends, there was no possibility of anyone's sanely disagreeing with a socialist ideology. The Right existed only to serve vested or unspeakable interests. Thus, the rallies "With God and for Freedom" organized by the "Catholic ladies" in support of the military coup appeared to us as the cynical, hypocritical gestures of evil people.<br><br>The coup, carried out in the name of the war against international communism, had put in power a man called Marshal Castelo Branco, a military officer of the so-called American line of thinking, meaning that he, unlike those called "Prussians" (who yearned to be centralizing nationalists), wanted to wipe out the Left and corruption in Brazil in order to turn it over to the modernity of the free market. Almost all of us were unaware of those nuances back then, and even if we had been, it would have changed nothing; we saw the coup simply as a decision to halt the redress of the horrible social inequities in Brazil and, simultaneously, to sustain North American supremacy in the hemisphere. The trend toward establishing a political art, sketched out in 1963 by the Centros Populares de Cultura (Centers for Popular Culture) of UNE (the National Students' Union) became widespread in all conventional artistic production, and, in spite of repression at the universities and censorship of the media, show business fell under the hegemony of the Left. In a highly politicized student environment, MPB (M&#x153;sica Popular Brasileira) functioned as an arena for important decisions concerning Brazilian culture and even national sovereignty-and the media covered it accordingly. And it was at MPB's huge televised festivals that the world of the students interacted with that of the wide masses of TV spectators. (The latter were naturally much more numerous than the record buyers.) At these events, one could encounter the more or less conscious illusion that this was where the problems of national affirmation, social justice, and advances in modernization were to be resolved. Market questions, often the only decisive ones, did not seem noble enough to be included in heated discussions. Of course girls would scream "beautiful!" when Chico Buarque came onstage (and, with far less reason, started screaming the same at me), but the conversations and hostilities between the groups would focus as much on an artist's political attitude and his fidelity to national characteristics as on his harmonic or rhythmic daring. That it should be so was a luxury. As silly as this state of things could be, we were living in an exceptionally stimulating period for composers, singers, and musicians. And one thing rang true: the recognition of MPB's power among us. Everything was heightened by the instinctive rejection of the military dictatorship, which seemed to unify the whole of the artistic class around a common objective: to oppose it.<br><br>Elizabeth Bishop, the American poet who lived in Brazil between 1952 and 1970, praised the rallies organized in support of the military, explaining in letters to her friends in the United States that while those demonstrations had "originally been organized as anticommunist parades," they "were becoming victory marches-more than one million people marching in the rain!" And she concludes: "It was totally spontaneous, they could not <i>all</i> be rich and right-wing reactionaries." Today, when I read those words, I am even more astonished by the distortion of my own point of view at the time than by the author's (though, to be sure, hers was no less distorted). To discover her version of the coup d'�tat causes me some unease, but it is one more lesson, in these times when private virtues must be taken as the causes of public evils, to come to the realization that back then someone-a woman poet at that!-might thus sum up the military coup that sent to jail some of my finest schoolmates and professors: "A few brave generals and the governors of three important states got together and, after a difficult forty-eight hours, it was all over. The (favorable) reactions have been really popular, thank God." Apparently there was such a thing as right-wing good intentions.<br><br>In 1964 the Left consisted of every Brazilian who deserved to be one, and all human beings worthy of the name. Ant�nio Ris�rio points out, in his essay about Bahia during the pre-1964 democratic period, that when the Austrian intellectual Otto Maria Carpeaux arrived in Brazil to escape Hitler, he had already noticed that here "almost everyone" was a leftist. My intention in this book is to tell and interpret the adventure of a creative impulse that emerged within Brazilian pop music in the second half of the sixties, whose protagonists-among them the narrator-wanted the freedom to move beyond the automatic ties with the Left and at the same time to account for the visceral rebellion against the abysmal disparities that tear a people asunder, even as that people remains singular an...</p><h2>The Permaculture Way: Practical Steps to Create a Self-Sustaining World</h2><p><p><em>The Permaculture Way</em> shows us how to consciously design a lifestyle which is low in environmental impact and highly productive.

It was an immediate success when first published in 1974, and since 1987 it has been regarded as the most highly prized and sought after out-of-print astrological classic. A handbook introduced astrology to a new generation of educated seekers turning to astrology not to know &#34;what will happen and how it can be avoided if it&#39;s unpleasant&#34; but to discover their innate potential and life purpose. Readers first exposed to serious astrology through this volume figure largely among today&#39;s leading astrologers and astrological writers. The volume not only changed the way we view astrology and what we expect from it, A Handbook for the Humanistic Astrologer forever changed the look and feel of astrological literature and horoscope graphics. It&#39;s concise format and presentation style has been emulated by numerous publications, and its entirely original horoscope graphics, first developed by the author during the 1960&#39;s, have been copied (unacknowledged) by countless astrological books, horoscope calculation services and astrology software developers. Founded upon the repeatedly proven premise that anyone can quickly learn the core principles of astrology and put them to use to improve ones life and relationships, A Handbook for the Humanistic Astrologer intentionally avoids the usual cookbook format in favor of exploring astrology&#39;s fundamental concepts and principles. In it and in his other works, such as The Astrology of Relationship, Michael R. Meyer demonstrates his unmatched ability to make astrology accessible to everyone.</p><p>Michael R.

Ariprovided the world with an unprecedented glimpse of theGreek shipping magnate's orbit of dizzying wealth, twistedintrigues, and questionable mores. Not long after the bookappeared, however, Onassis's daughter Christina and hislongtime business partner Yannis Georgakis hinted toEvans that he had missed the "real story" -- one that provedOnassis's intrigues had deadly results. "I must begin,"Georgakis said, "with the premise that, for Onassis, BobbyKennedy was unfinished business from way back..."</p><p>His words launched Evans into the heart of a story thattightly bound Onassis not to Jackie's first husband, but tohis ambitious younger brother Bobby. A bitter rivalryemerged between Bobby and Ari long before Onassis andJackie had even met. <em>Nemesis</em> reveals the tangled thread ofevents that linked two of the world's most powerful men intheir intense hatred for one another and uncovers thesurprising role played by the woman they both loved. Theirpower struggle unfolds against a heady backdrop ofinternational intrigue: Bobby Kennedy's discovery of theGreek shipping magnate's shady dealings, which led him tobar Onassis from trade with the United States; Onassis'sattempt to control much of Saudi Arabia's oil; Onassis'suntimely love affair with Jackie's married sister LeeRadziwill; and his bold invitation to First Lady Jackie tojoin him on his yacht -- without the president. Just as theself-made Greek tycoon gloried in the chance to stir thewrath of the Kennedys, they struggled unsuccessfully tobreak his spell over the woman who held the key to all oftheir futures. After Jack's death, Bobby became ever closerto Camelot's holy widow, and fought to keep her frommarrying his sworn rival. But Onassis rarely failed to getwhat he wanted, and Jackie became his wife shortly afterBobby was killed.</p><p>Through extensive interviews with the closest friends,lovers, and relatives of Onassis and the Kennedys, longtimejournalist Evans has uncovered the shocking culmination ofthe Kennedy-Onassis-Kennedy love triangle: AristotleOnassis was at the heart of the plot to kill Bobby Kennedy.Meticulously tracing Onassis's connections in the world ofterrorism, <em>Nemesis</em> presents compelling evidence that hefinanced the assassination -- including a startling confessionthat has gone unreported for nearly three decades. Alongthe way, this groundbreaking work also daringly paintsthese international icons in all of their true colors. FromEvans's deeply nuanced portraits of the charismatic Greekshipping magnate and his acquisitive iconic bride to hisprobing and revelatory look into the events that shaped anera, <em>Nemesis</em> is a work that will not be soon forgotten.</p></p><p><p>Peter Evans, an award-winning former journalist and foreign correspondent, is the author of ten books, including <strong>Ari</strong>, <strong>Goodbye Baby</strong> and <strong>Amen</strong>, and the bestselling novel <strong>The Englishman's Daughter</strong>.

He volunteered for the job well aware that hanging out of slow-moving choppers over hot LZs blazing with enemy fire was not conducive to a long life. But that wasn&#x2019;t going to stop Specialist Sever.<br><br>From Da Nang to Cu Chi and the Mekong Delta, Sever spent thirty-one months in Vietnam, fighting in eleven of the war&#x2019;s sixteen campaigns. Every morning when his gunship lifted off, often to the clacking and muzzle flashes of AK-47s hidden in the dawn fog, Sever knew he might not return. This raw, gritty, gut-wrenching firsthand account of American boys fighting and dying in Vietnam captures all the hell, horror, and heroism of that tragic war.</p><p><b>AL SEVER</b>, a crew member on various types of helicopters, served in Vietnam from the heavy combat days of 1968 to the moral and physical disintegration of our forces in 1972. From the Delta to the DMZ, he observed the varied facets of the war as the opposing armies clashed and maneuvered throughout the country. He lives in Montoursville, Pennsylvania.<b><br></b>Anthracite coal country, hard coal and hard times, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, is where I'm from. Not a prosperous place during my youth, it still isn't. Energy competition from fuel oil and natural gas had made most coal mines in the county uneconomical after World War II and Schuylkill County, instead of joining the country's postwar boom, slipped back toward the Depression. Growing up, it was rare to see neighbors buy new cars, eat in restaurants or take a vacation. Our families seemed to just barely get by. But, since everyone was in the same economic boat, we young people felt the situation was probably the same everywhere. While television and movies indicated there was a prosperous life out there, we tended to regard such indications as fairy tales.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our small town was a typical mining community, probably extinct in America today. It was a town of four thousand people with two movie theaters, two supermarkets, thirty-five bars and twenty-seven churches. Like other nearby mining towns, ours had a lot of bars because they were the social meeting places for neighborhoods. There were a lot of churches because no one would ever think of going to church with people of a different nationality. We might work together, go to school together and drink together, but, whether Catholic or Protestant, church was for those of your own ethnic group from the old country. We grew up hearing a dozen foreign languages spoken on our block, and being American kids, we learned none of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> We didn't have many diversions growing up and were left to find our own amusements. Society catered to adults then, not children. Like all teenagers we talked about what we were going to do and where we would go, and we were all sure that we would never stay in Saint Clair. Judging from our environment, life was going to be a struggle to get by, but we realized the struggle probably would be easier somewhere else. There were quite a few boys in my high school class who looked to the military as a way of escaping the reality of closed coal mines.<br> &nbsp;<br> The older males we knew were strictly blue-collar workers whose biggest adventure in life was to have served in the Big War, WWII. We grew up hearing stories of our relatives and neighbors conquering the Japanese and Germans. They had marched through Burma; sailed the Pacific and North Atlantic; parachuted into France; blown up a bank and filled knapsacks with jewels in Belgium; lost their booty in German counterattacks; were the Bulge at Bastogne; drove the first tank into Manila.<br> &nbsp;<br> After WWII stories, it seemed that every adult's second favorite conversation was to complain about every level of government. Yet it was somehow understood that everyone was expected to back the government and its policies, no matter what their personal feelings might be about those policies. During the Viet Nam War years, adult discussions always generalized the conflict as a waste of time, money and lives, but there was never what would be called an anti-war mentality. Instead, conversations were slanted toward the stupidity of those in charge. It made no sense to our citizens that the government would expend such energy and funds on an unknown third world country like Viet Nam. Who cared if it went Communist? To those who had fought for continents, wasting years and men for rice paddies and jungle was incomprehensible. Where was the Paris to liberate? Where was the evil madman to destroy? Our television news programs showed American troops burning peasant homes and villages, not liberating them.<br> &nbsp;<br> A stranger might have thought there was a lack of support in our country for the war in Viet Nam. Not true. In our communities, it was accepted that, if a young man was of military draft age, he should anticipate serving in the armed forces. There were very few draft dodgers in our county and no organized antiwar movement. If drafted, a young man was expected to serve honorably. There was no lack of support for the common soldier.<br> &nbsp;<br> While the draft was accepted as part of our lives, it was also the local consensus that, while one might be drafted, no one would be so foolish as to actually join the U.S. Army. If you were going to volunteer, join the Navy, the Air Force or even the Marines. Any armed service but the Army. Most of the older men remembering World War II thought that the Army wasted its troops, using them as cannon fodder. In their opinion, the Army of World War II fought a war of attrition&#x2014;the favorite tactic being a human wave attack. Joining the Navy or Air Force would at least mean a bed to sleep in and three hot meals a day. As for the Marines, our local veterans believed the Navy invented the Marines so that sailors wouldn't have to march in parades. Since most of our local veterans had served in the Army during World War II, they always rooted for Navy in the annual Army-Navy football game and strongly suggested that young men consider enlistment in other branches of the armed forces.<br> &nbsp;<br> For those of us in high school in the 1960s, there didn't appear to be many choices for the future. I doubt if any of us really knew what we wanted to do with our lives; we had no awareness of choices available. The military seemed the only profession interested in us&#x2014;they sent recruiters to the high school to talk to seniors. We were not the sons of doctors, lawyers or engineers and had no contact with people who were professionals. We were expected to find blue-collar work.<br> &nbsp;<br> I think back on high school as a warehouse for teenagers rather than an educational institution. It's surprising more of us didn't quit school. Even though fighting was occurring in Viet Nam, most of us knew older boys in the military and knew that relatively few troops were sent to Viet Nam. Local boys were coming home on leave from Iceland, Spain, Germany, Korea and other countries, but I knew of only two local boys who had gone to Viet Nam in 1966. When I graduated in June 1966, approximately 25 percent of my senior class had enlisted in the military. I was the only one going into the Army.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why did I join the Army? I viewed the military as an escape from small-town boredom and monotony. I wanted to experience adventure in capital letters. All through my senior year the news media were full of stories about the conflict in Viet Nam. I noticed most stories included helicopters. At eighteen, I wanted to experience war&#x2014;and helicopters. The U.S. Army seemed to be the way to go. I couldn't understand how other eighteen-year-old boys could consider joining the military to drive trucks, type, cook, et cetera. I picked helicopter training, not to learn a trade, but to ensure that I would get into combat.<br> &nbsp;<br> I doubt if very many boys of my age enlisted to purposely serve in Viet Nam. Many young men were doing everything they could to avoid serving anywhere. Quite a few of them would regret not having served with those who went. But we didn't really need them and they probably would have only slowed us down. I believe that Viet Nam was my generation's chance to do something unusual, and I had no intention of not participating in history. I was one of those boys of fighting age who were afraid to miss the action.<br> &nbsp;<br> Eight days following my graduation from high school, I raised my right hand and vowed to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Ten minutes later, I was boarding a bus headed south to Fort Gordon, Georgia, for basic training. Two hundred and thirty-nine young men and I were to spend eight weeks in Georgia under a hot summer sun learning the basic skills expected of every soldier in the U.S. Army. Here we would learn Close Order Drill (march in formation everywhere); military courtesy (everyone who outranked us should be considered a god); first aid (never use your battle dressing to bandage anyone else; save your clean battle dressing for your own wounds); the M-14 rifle (it's heavy so that when we ran out of ammunition, we could use it to beat someone to death); bayonet drill (tai chi); squadtactics (the guy behind you is more likely to shoot you than the enemy).<br> &nbsp;<br> We were welcomed to Fort Gordon by screaming drill sergeants who intimidated us before we even were out of our bus. Our first group activity was to march to the barber to get haircuts so that we would look alike. The military haircuts showed we had something in common&#x2014;whether city boys or country, northern Yankees or southern rebels&#x2014;scars on our heads from rock fights.<br> &nbsp;<br> We were measured for clothes and boots and were soon issued our clean, bright olive drab fatigues and black combat boots. During the next two months we would turn our clothes white with salt deposits from our sweat, while our boots would shine like mirrors from constant &#x201c;spit shining.&#x201d; All civilian clothes worn on our trip to Georgia were either shipped home or thrown away. We would be wearing nothing except green for a long time.<br> &nbsp;<br> My new home in Georgia would be an old two-story barracks built as a temporary building in World War II. Thirty men to one large room on each floor with no privacy whatsoever. We slept in bunk beds and soon learned why, if given a choice, a soldier always took a top bunk. No one sat on it to mess it up. Our clothes were hung on the wall behind the bunks in a prearranged order&#x2014;no fancy wall lockers here. Our footlockers sat in the barracks' center aisle and held small folded items like underwear and socks. The footlocker also held mandatory personal gear such as toothbrush and tooth powder (toothpaste was not allowed); shaving brush and shaving soap (no shaving cream allowed); a razor with five extra double-edge blades, no more, no less; comb (mandatory, even though we had no hair); cleaning items&#x2014; shoe polish, brass polish, et cetera. One day in the future we would realize that barracks life was easy living.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>It Shouldn&#39;t Happen to a Vet</h2><p>When newly qualified vet James Herriot arrives in the small Yorkshire village of Darrowby, he has no idea what to expect.

First, stand in front of Florsheim&#39;s Fifty-seventh Street window, press your face close to the glass, watch the fake velvet Hummels inside revolving around the wing tips; some white shoes, like your father wears, are propped up with garlands on a small mound of chemical snow. All the stores have closed. You can see your breath on the glass. Draw a peace sign. You are waiting for a bus.He emerges from nowhere, looks like Robert Culp, the fog rolling, then parting, then sort of closing up again behind him. He asks you for a light and you jump a bit, startled, but you give him your &#34;Lucky&#39;s Lounge--Where Leisure Is a Suit&#34; matches. He has a nice chuckle, nice fingernails. He lights the cigarette, cupping his hands around the end, and drags deeply, like a starving man. He smiles as he exhales, returns you the matches, looks at your face, says: &#34;Thanks.&#34;He then stands not far from you, waiting. Perhaps for the same bus. The two of you glance furtively at each other, shifting feet. Pretend to contemplate the chemical snow. You are two spies glancing quickly at watches, necks disappearing in the hunch of your shoulders, collars upturned and slowly razoring the cab and store-lit fog like sharkfins. You begin to circle, gauging each other in primordial sniffs, eyeing, sidling, keen as Basil Rathbone.A bus arrives. It is crowded, everyone looking laughlessly into one another&#39;s underarms. A blonde woman in barrettes steps off, holding her shoes in one hand.You climb on together, grab adjacent chrome posts, and when the bus hisses and rumbles forward, you take out a book. A minute goes by and he asks what you&#39;re reading. It is Madame Bovary in a Doris Day biography jacket. Try to explain about binding warpage. He smiles, interested.Return to your book. Emma is opening her window, thinking of Rouen.&#34;What weather,&#34; you hear him sigh, faintly British or uppercrust Delaware.Glance up. Say: &#34;It is fit for neither beast nor vegetable.&#34;It sounds dumb. It makes no sense.But it is how you meet.At the movies he is tender, caressing your hand beneath the seat.At concerts he is sweet and attentive, buying cocktails, locating the ladies&#39; lounge when you can&#39;t find it.At museums he is wise and loving, leading you slowly through the Etruscan cinerary urns with affectionate gestures and an art history minor from Columbia. He is kind; he laughs at your jokes.After four movies, three concerts, and two-and-a-half museums, you sleep with him. It seems the right number of cultural events. On the stereo you play your favorite harp and oboe music. He tells you his wife&#39;s name. It is Patricia. She is an intellectual property lawyer. He tells you he likes you a lot. You lie on your stomach, naked and still too warm. When he says, &#34;How do you feel about that?&#34; don&#39;t say &#34;Ridiculous&#34; or &#34;Get the hell out of my apartment.&#34; Prop your head up with one hand and say: &#34;It depends. What is intellectual property law?&#34;He grins. &#34;Oh, you know. Where leisure is a suit.&#34;Give him a tight, wiry little smile.&#34;I just don&#39;t want you to feel uncomfortable about this,&#34; he says.Say: &#34;Hey. I am a very cool person. I am tough.&#34; Show him your bicep.When you were six you thought mistress meant to put your shoes on the wrong feet. Now you are older and know it can mean many things, but essentially it means to put your shoes on the wrong feet.You walk differently. In store windows you don&#39;t recognize yourself; you are another woman, some crazy interior display lady in glasses stumbling frantic and preoccupied through the mannequins. In public restrooms you sit dangerously flat against the toilet seat, a strange flesh sundae of despair and exhilaration, murmuring into your bluing thighs: &#34;Hello, I&#39;m Charlene. I&#39;m a mistress.&#34;It is like having a book out from the library.It is like constantly having a book out from the library.You meet frequently for dinner, after work, split whole liters of the house red, then wamble the two blocks east, twenty blocks south to your apartment and lie sprawled on the living room floor with your expensive beige raincoats still on.He is a systems analyst--you have already exhausted this joke--but what he really wants to be, he reveals to you, is an actor.&#34;Well, how did you become a systems analyst?&#34; you ask, funny you.&#34;The same way anyone becomes anything,&#34; he muses. &#34;I took courses and sent out resumes.&#34; Pause. &#34;Patricia helped me work up a great resume. Too great.&#34;&#34;Oh.&#34; Wonder about mistress courses, certification, resumes. Perhaps you are not really qualified.&#34;But I&#39;m not good at systems work,&#34; he says, staring through and beyond, way beyond, the cracked ceiling. &#34;Figuring out the cost-effectiveness of two hundred people shuffling five hundred pages back and forth across a new four-and-a-half-by-three-foot desk. I&#39;m not an organized person, like Patricia, for instance. She&#39;s just incredibly organized. She makes lists for everything. It&#39;s pretty impressive.&#34;Say flatly, dully: &#34;What?&#34; &#34;That she makes lists.&#34;&#34;That she makes lists? You like that?&#34;&#34;Well, yes. You know, what she&#39;s going to do, what she has to buy, names of clients she has to see, et cetera.&#34;&#34;Lists?&#34; you murmur hopelessly, listlessly, your expensive beige raincoat still on. There is a long, tired silence. Lists? You stand up, brush off your coat, ask him what he would like to drink, then stump off to the kitchen without waiting for the answer.At one-thirty, he gets up noiselessly except for the soft rustle of his dressing. He leaves before you have even quite fallen asleep, but before he does, he bends over you in his expensive beige raincoat and kisses the ends of your hair. Ah, he kisses your hair.CLIENTS TO SEEBirthday snapshotsScotch tapeLetters to TD and MomTechnically, you are still a secretary for Karma-Kola, but you wear your Phi Beta Kappa key around your neck on a cheap gold chain, hoping someone will spot you for a promotion. Unfortunately, you have lost the respect of all but one of your co-workers and many of your superiors as well, who are working in order to send their daughters to universities so they won&#39;t have to be secretaries, and who, therefore, hold you in contempt for having a degree and being a failure anyway. It is like having a degree in failure. Hilda, however, likes you. You are young and remind her of her sister, the professional skater.&#34;But I hate to skate,&#34; you say.And Hilda smiles, nodding. &#34;Yup, that&#39;s exactly what my sister says sometimes and in that same way.&#34;What way?&#34;&#34;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&#34; says Hilda. &#34;Your bangs parted on the side or something.&#34;Ask Hilda if she will go to lunch with you. Over Reuben sandwiches ask her if she&#39;s ever had an affair with a married man. As she attempts, mid-bite, to complete the choreography of her chomp, Russian dressing spurts out onto her hands.&#34;Once,&#34; she says. &#34;That was the last lover I had. That was over two years ago.Say: &#34;Oh my god,&#34; as if it were horrible and tragic, then try to mitigate that rudeness by clearing your throat and saying, &#34;Well, actually, I guess that&#39;s not so bad.&#34;&#34;No,&#34; she sighs good-naturedly. &#34;His wife had Hodgkin&#39;s disease, or so everyone thought.

Make another list.Whisper, &#34;Don&#39;t go yet,&#34; as he glides out of your bed before sunrise and you lie there on your back cooling, naked between the sheets and smelling of musky, oniony sweat. Feel gray, like an abandoned locker room towel. Watch him as he again pulls on his pants, his sweater, his socks and shoes. Reach out and hold his thigh as he leans over and kisses you quickly, telling you not to get up, that he&#39;ll lock the door when he leaves. In the smoky darkness, you see him smile weakly, guiltily, and attempt a false, jaunty wave from the doorway. Turn on your side, toward the wall, so you don&#39;t have to watch the door close. You hear it thud nonetheless, the jangle of keys and snap of the bolt lock, the footsteps loud, then fading down the staircase, the clunk of the street door, then nothing, all his sounds blending with the city, his face passing namelessly uptown in a bus or a badly heated cab, the room, the whole building you live in, shuddering at the windows as a truck roars by toward the Queensboro Bridge.Wonder who you are.&#34;Hi, this is Attila,&#34; he says in a false deep voice when you pick up your office phone.Giggle.

I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t eat meat.&#34;Cute, you&#39;re cute,&#34; he says, not laughing, and at lunch he gives you his tomatoes.Drink two huge glasses of wine and smile at all his office and mother-in-law stories. It makes his eyes sparkle and crinkle at the corners, his face pleased and shining. When the waitress clears the plates away, there is a silence where the two of you look down then back up again.&#34;You get more beautiful every day,&#34; he says to you, as you hold your wine glass over your nose, burgundy rushing down your throat. Put your glass down. Redden. Smile. Fiddle with your Phi Beta Kappa key.When you get up to leave, take deep breaths. In front of the restaurant, where you will stride off in different directions, don&#39;t give him a kiss in the noontime throng. Patricia&#39;s office is nearby and she likes to go to the bank right around now; his back will stiffen and his eyes dart around like a crazy person&#39;s. Instead, do a quick shuffle-ball-chain like you saw Barbra Streisand do in a movie once. Wave gigantically and say: &#34;Till we eat again.&#34;In your office building the elevator is slow and packed and you forget to get off at the tenth floor and have to ride all the way back down again from the nineteenth. Five minutes after you arrive dizzily back at your desk, the phone rings.&#34;Meet me tomorrow at seven,&#34; he says, &#34;in front of Florsheim&#39;s and I&#39;ll carry you off to my castle. Patricia is going to a copyright convention.&#34;Wait freezing in front of Florsheim&#39;s until seven-twenty. He finally dashes up, gasping apologies (he just now got back from the airport), his coat flying open, and he takes you in tow quickly uptown toward the art museums. He lives near art museums. Ask him what a copyright convention is.&#34;Where leisure is a suit and a suite,&#34; he drawls, long and smiling, quickening his pace and yours. He kisses your temple, brushes hair off your face.You arrive at his building in twenty minutes.&#34;So, this is it?&#34; The castle doorman&#39;s fly is undone. Smile politely. In the elevator, say: &#34;The unexamined fly is not worth zipping.&#34;The elevator has a peculiar rattle, for all eight floors, like someone obsessively clearing her throat.When he finally gets the apartment door unlocked, he shows you into an L-shaped living room bursting with plants and gold-framed posters announcing exhibitions you are too late for by six years. The kitchen is off to one side--tiny, digital, spare, with a small army of chrome utensils hanging belligerent and clean as blades on the wall. Walk nervously around like a dog sniffing out the place. Peek into the bedroom: in the center, like a giant bloom, is a queen-sized bed with a Pennsylvania Dutch spread. A small photo of a woman in ski garb is propped on a nightstand. It frightens you.Back in the living room, he mixes drinks with Scotch in them. &#34;So, this is it,&#34; you say again with a forced grin and an odd heaving in your rib cage. Light up one of his cigarettes.&#34;Can I take your coat?&#34;Be strange and awkward. Say: &#34;I like beige. I think it is practical.&#34;&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34; he says, handing you your drink.Try to decide what you should do:1. rip open the front of your coat, sending the buttons torpedoing across the room in a series of pops into the asparagus fern;2. go into the bathroom and gargle with hot tap water;3. go downstairs and wave down a cab for home.He puts his mouth on your neck. Put your arms timidly around him. Whisper into his ear: &#34;There&#39;s a woman, uh, another woman in your room.When he is fast asleep upon you, in the middle of the night, send your left arm out slowly toward the nightstand like a mechanical limb programmed for a secret intelligence mission, and bring the ski garb picture back close to your face in the dark and try to study the features over his shoulder. She seems to have a pretty smile, short hair, no eyebrows, tough flaring nostrils, body indecipherably ensconced in nylon and down and wool.Slip carefully out, like a shoe horn, from beneath his sleeping body--he grunts groggily--and go to the closet. Open it with a minimum of squeaking and stare at her clothes. A few suits. Looks like beige blouses and a lot of brown things. Turn on the closet light. Look at the shoes. They are all lined up in neat, married pairs on the closet floor. Black pumps, blue sneakers, brown moccasins, brown T-straps. They have been to an expensive college, say, in Massachusetts. Gaze into her shoes. Her feet are much larger than yours. They are like small cruise missiles.Inside the caves of those shoes, eyes form and open their lids, stare up at you, regard you, wink at you from the insoles. They are half-friendly, conspiratorial, amused at this reconnaissance of yours, like little smiling men from the open hatches of a fleet of military submarines. Turn off the light and shut the door quickly, before they start talking or dancing or something. Scurry back to the bed and hide your face in his armpit.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Panic: A Guide to Introductory Physics for Students of Science and Engineering: Mechanics (Volume 1 (Mechanics))</h2><p>This is a user-friendly textbook.

Yet its story is not fully known. In <i>Auschwitz</i>, Laurence Rees reveals new insights from more than 100 original interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators who speak on the record for the first time. Their testimonies provide a portrait of the inner workings of the camp in unrivalled detail&#x2014;from the techniques of mass murder, to the politics and gossip mill that turned between guards and prisoners, to the on-camp brothel in which the lines between those guards and prisoners became surprisingly blurred.<br> Rees examines the strategic decisions that led the Nazi leadership to prescribe Auschwitz as its primary site for the extinction of Europe's Jews&#x2014;their "Final Solution." He concludes that many of the horrors that were perpetrated in Auschwitz were driven not just by ideological inevitability but as a "practical" response to a war in the East that had begun to go wrong for Germany. A terrible immoral pragmatism characterizes many of the decisions that determined what happened at Auschwitz. Thus the story of the camp becomes a morality tale, too, in which evil is shown to proceed in a series of deft, almost noiseless incremental steps until it produces the overwhelming horror of the industrial scale slaughter that was inflicted in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.</p><p><b>Laurence Rees</b> is Creative Director of History Programs for the BBC and author of five books, including <i>The Nazis: A Warning from History</i> and <i>Horror in the East: Japan and the Atrocities of World War II</i>. He lives in London.Most of us would rather not think about Auschwitz, but that is how the next Auschwitz will happen. Laurence Rees's compact, devastating new history of the infamous death factory distills a crucial lesson -- perhaps the crucial lesson -- of the 20th century: that the human capacity for mass murder is grotesquely widespread and must be faced squarely if we hope to resist it.<p>The systematized, industrialized, conveyor-belt murder of six million Jews and other despised minorities is hard to fathom. I recently visited a community center in Florida where two enormous jars, each as tall as a basketball player and as fat as a sumo wrestler, were being filled with pennies in hopes of collecting six million.</p><p>But as Rees unfolds the singular atrocity of Auschwitz-Birkenau, where one million died, the recurring theme is just how easily it happened. From the monstrous planners to the demoralized bystanders, Europe was full of people willing to countenance the genocide. The ideals of Western civilization were like tissue paper across the tracks of human hatred.</p><p>Auschwitz devolved smoothly from a slave-labor camp to a death camp as Hitler's war in the East bogged down. In village after village, city after city, people watched wordlessly, even jeered triumphantly, as their neighbors were herded toward the transports -- not just the Germans of Berlin and Munich and Leipzig, but Poles in Warsaw, Frenchmen in Paris, Hungarians in Budapest, Slovakians in Bratislava, even, in a few cases, British authorities in the Channel Islands. </p><p>Some of the perpetrators were monsters, like the camp's commandant, Rudolph H�ss, and the master of the human roundups, Adolf Eichmann. Some were ordinary people who could have saved a life or two but just . . . didn't. Most fell in between: They did not plan the genocide, but it did not seem to bother them much. Take the stupidly cruel French police who, without much prodding from the Nazis, organized a large shipment of Jewish women and children: Far from being moved by the suffering they supervised, they heedlessly compounded it, herding the mothers onto transports many days before the children were to be shipped. As Rees recounts in spare, heartbreaking prose, the French authorities made no provision for the orphaned children, leaving them to wander -- terrified and barely fed -- around the French holding camp until trains finally came for them.</p><p>But the killers were not without tender feelings. Rees notes that it upset them very much when the people they were preparing for slaughter began screaming or struggling or fainting. It wore them out when they tried shooting their victims one by one beside mass graves. That is why they built efficient gas chambers, with soundproof walls and nearby crematoria. And it is why they took elaborate steps to mask what they were doing.</p><p>So we find workers at Auschwitz, on Oct. 7, 1944, coaxing the shivering, hungry children from Barrack 8 in the Birkenau annex with a promise of warm winter clothes. Alice Lok Cahana, 15, hoped to scrounge a few garments for her sickly sister, Edith. The children were led to a brick building in a corner of the compound and told to strip off their rags.</p><p>Alice did not panic, and the reason is quite horrible. She noticed "flowers in a window" of the building she was about to enter -- which was, of course, a gas chamber. Flowers made her think of her mother, who loved violets, and so she felt calm. </p><p>Her murder was interrupted by a revolt of the crematoria workers, quickly quelled. Cahana survived to add this arresting and revolting detail to Rees's picture of the camp. </p><p>Rees, a distinguished journalist and historian at the BBC, layers these details with little fanfare but great craftsmanship. His book, and a companion TV documentary, mark the 60th anniversary this month of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops.</p><p>Ultimately he does at the gut level what Hannah Arendt achieved some 40 years ago at the level of philosophy: He forces the reader to shift the Holocaust out of the realm of nightmare or Gothic horror and acknowledge it as something all too human. He reminds us that building Auschwitz required the services not just of sadists but of architects and engineers, that staffing it required the efforts of physicians and bookkeepers. </p><p>We see again that an impetus for the first gassings came not from Berlin but from Slovakia, whose pro-Nazi government was happy to round up able-bodied Jews to be pressed into slavery in the IG Farben synthetic-rubber works at Auschwitz. Then the Slovaks realized they would be stuck with a Jewish remnant unable to provide for itself, so they paid the Nazis to take the elderly, the frail, the children to Auschwitz as well. Killing them seemed the expedient thing to do.</p><p>Reading this book is an ordeal -- not through any failure of the author's but because of his success. Rees's research is impeccable and intrepid; among other feats, he has tracked down and interviewed former SS members who actually worked at Auschwitz, most of whom express no remorse. Rees also makes good use of the records that became available only after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its satellites.</p><p>These details add up to a precise picture of the death camp -- not only the sadistic kapos, the merciless selections, the industrial-scale killing, but also the perverse love stories, doomed uprisings, weird strokes of luck. Rees tells the bizarre story of the Auschwitz brothel, and details the one successful escape from the camp. He explains why the only hope of survival was a job indoors, and reports that the best jobs were in the warehouses where Jews were compelled to sort and catalogue the stolen possessions of their murdered brethren.</p><p>Scrupulous and honest, this book is utterly without illusions. The nearest thing it has to an uplifting story is the successful effort by Danes to save their country's Jews. Even this ends on a sad note in Rees's hands. Why, he wonders, could similar feats not have been accomplished all across Europe?</p><p>The answer emerges in the final pages, as Rees recounts stories of Auschwitz survivors returning to their homes months and years and even decades later, only to be greeted with fresh bigotry and new violence. More lives were not saved because human beings found it more convenient to hate. The potted bigotry and ludicrous rantings of tyrants spoke more deeply to them than the exhortations of saints. </p><p>It is folly to believe that hatred could be so widespread and so easily activated in 1945 yet be toothless today. Neighbors hacked neighbors to death in Rwanda; mountains of skulls rose in Cambodia; entire classes of people were worked and starved to death in China; even Hitler's brand of bigotry is common currency in much of the world. </p><p>Indeed, hate seems to be thriving. As long as it does, Auschwitz is with us. </p><p>Reviewed by David Von Drehle <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved.</p></p>
